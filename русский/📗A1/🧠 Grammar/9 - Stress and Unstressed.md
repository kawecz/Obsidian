## 🧾 Introduction

In Russian, **stress (ударение)** is _phonemic_:

- It changes the pronunciation of vowels.
    
- It often changes the **meaning** or **part of speech**.
    
- It isn’t marked in writing (except in dictionaries or textbooks).
    

Understanding **stressed (ударные)** and **unstressed (безударные)** syllables is key to pronouncing Russian naturally.

## 📍 What is _stress_ in Russian?

Every Russian word of two or more syllables has **one stressed syllable**:

- **Stressed syllable (ударный слог):** pronounced louder, longer, and clearer.
    
- **Unstressed syllables (безударные):** pronounced faster and vowels may be reduced.
    

Example:

|Word|Stressed letter|Pronunciation|
|---|---|---|
|вода́ (_water_)|а́|ва-да́|
|ру́чка (_pen_)|у́|ру́ч-ка|

## 🔊 Why stress matters

Changing stress can change the meaning:

|Word|Meaning|
|---|---|
|за́мок|castle|
|замо́к|lock|

Or it can distinguish forms:

- му́ка (_flour_) vs. мука́ (_torment_)
    
- пла́чу (_I pay_) vs. плачу́ (_I’m crying_)

## 🧪 Effect on vowels

In unstressed syllables, Russian vowels often get **reduced**:

|Letter|Stressed|Unstressed|
|---|---|---|
|а / о|clear “a” / “o”|sound more like “a” or “ə”|
|е|“ye”|often closer to “i”|
|я|“ya”|closer to “i”|
|э|stays “e”|can weaken|

Example:

- молоко́ (_milk_): [ма-ла-ко́]
    
- In the first two syllables, “о” sounds like “a”.

## 🧠 Tips to remember

- **Always memorize new words with their stress!** (e.g., семья́, доро́га)
    
- Listen to native speakers and repeat.
    
- Mark the stress (with an accent) in your notes when you learn new words.
    
- Remember: stress can move in plural or different cases.

## ✅ Conclusion

In Russian, every word has one **stressed syllable** that stays strong and clear, while **unstressed syllables get reduced**.  
Stress isn’t written, so you must **learn it** with each word — it’s essential for correct pronunciation and meaning.

# 🗣 Russian Stress & Vowel Reduction

## 📉 Part 1 – Words showing vowel reduction

In these words, see how the stressed vowel is pronounced clearly, but the **unstressed “о”, “а”, “е”, or “я” get reduced** (usually to a sound like [ə] or [и]).

|Word|Stress|Pronunciation pattern|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|
|молоко́|мо-ло-ко́|Only the last “о” sounds like “o”; first two sound like “a”|milk|
|голова́|го-ло-ва́|Only the last “а” is [a]; first two sound like “ə”|head|
|вода́|ва-да́|first “о” sounds like “a”|water|
|собака́|са-ба-ка́|first “о” sounds like “a”|dog|
|доро́га|до-ро́-га|first “о” sounds like “a”|road|
|му́зыка|му́-зы-ка|first “у” stressed, others weaken|music|
|земля́|зем-ля́|unstressed “е” often pronounced closer to “и”|earth, land|
|зима́|зи-ма́|unstressed “и” can sound shorter|winter|

**Tip:** In unstressed position,

- “о” → usually sounds like “а”
    
- “е”, “я” → can sound closer to “и”
