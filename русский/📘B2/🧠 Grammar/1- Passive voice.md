|üá∑üá∫ Topic|1 - Passive Voice in Russian (–°—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–ª–æ–≥)|
|---|---|

### üìö Introduction

The **passive voice** in Russian (—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–ª–æ–≥) is used to shift the focus from **who performs** an action to **who or what receives** it. While it's less common in spoken Russian than in English, it plays an important role in written language, especially in formal, academic, and journalistic contexts. Understanding how to recognize and form the passive voice in Russian is essential for expressing complex ideas and reading comprehension.

### üß± 1 - What is the Passive Voice?

The passive voice emphasizes the **object** of the action rather than the subject (the doer). For example:

- **Active**: –ú–∞–º–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. ‚Äì _Mom is reading a book._
    
- **Passive**: –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –º–∞–º–æ–π. ‚Äì _The book is being read by Mom._
    

In Russian, the passive voice is typically formed using:

- Passive participles (past or present)
    
- Reflexive verbs (-—Å—è)
    
- The verb **–±—ã—Ç—å** (to be) in various tenses (less common in modern usage)

### üß™ 2 - Forming Passive Voice with Participles

#### üîπ Past Passive Participles + –±—ã—Ç—å

|Tense|Structure|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Present (rare/formal)|–±—ã—Ç—å (present) + past passive participle|–î–æ–º **—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—Å—è**. (_The house is being built_)|
|Past|–±—ã—Ç—å (past) + past passive participle|–î–æ–º **–±—ã–ª –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω**. (_The house was built_)|
|Future|–±—ã—Ç—å (future) + past passive participle|–î–æ–º **–±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω**. (_The house will be built_)|

#### üîπ Examples of Passive Participles

|Verb|Past Passive Participle|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å (to write)|–Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π|written|
|—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å (to read)|–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π|read|
|–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å (to do)|—Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π|done|
|—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—å (to build)|–ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π|built|

### üîÅ 3 - Reflexive Passive Voice (-—Å—è verbs)

In Russian, many passive constructions are formed using the **reflexive suffix -—Å—è**, especially in the present tense. This is more common in everyday speech.

|Active|Passive with -—Å—è|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–û–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ—è—Ç –¥–æ–º.|–î–æ–º **—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—Å—è**.|The house is being built.|
|–û–Ω–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.|–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ **—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è**.|The book is being read.|
|–õ—é–¥–∏ –æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–∞—é—Ç —Ç–µ–º—É.|–¢–µ–º–∞ **–æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è**.|The topic is being discussed.|

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4 - Agent in Passive Voice (–ö–µ–º?)

When it's necessary to mention **who is doing the action**, Russian uses the instrumental case with **–∫–µ–º** ("by whom").

|Passive Sentence|Translation|
|---|---|
|–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –±—ã–ª–∞ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∞ **–∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º**.|The book was written **by the author**.|
|–î–æ–º —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—Å—è **—Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏–º–∏**.|The house is being built **by workers**.|

### üéØ Conclusion

The passive voice in Russian allows speakers to highlight the **receiver of the action**, often omitting or de-emphasizing the doer. While more common in formal writing, it‚Äôs essential for comprehension and expression in various contexts. Russian forms the passive voice using **past passive participles**, **-—Å—è constructions**, and occasionally **–±—ã—Ç—å**. Understanding these structures makes your Russian more expressive and precise.
