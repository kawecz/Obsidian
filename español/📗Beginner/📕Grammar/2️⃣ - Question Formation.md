🌟 **Question Formation in Spanish** 🌟  
📚 **Topic 2️⃣: How to Ask Questions – Structure, Tone & Interrogatives**

📘 **Introduction**

Questions are the **heartbeat of conversation**—they invite interaction, curiosity, and understanding. In Spanish, forming questions is often more straightforward than in English: there’s **no need for auxiliary verbs** like _do_ or _does_. Instead, Spanish relies on **word order, vocal tone, and interrogative words** (_qué, cómo, dónde..._) to form both **yes/no** and **open-ended** questions. Learning how to ask questions correctly is essential for real-life communication in shops, classrooms, travel, and everyday conversation. ❓🗣️🌍

|**Yes/No**|_¿Estudias español?_|Do you study Spanish?|
|**Open-ended**|_¿Dónde vives?_|Where do you live?|

## 🟠 **Yes/No Questions: Simple Inversion or Intonation**

Spanish often keeps the word order **identical** to a statement—what changes is **intonation** (spoken) or **punctuation** (written).

|Statement|Question|
|---|---|
|Tú hablas inglés.|¿Tú hablas inglés?|
|Ellos comen pizza.|¿Ellos comen pizza?|
|Vamos al cine.|¿Vamos al cine?|

📝 **Examples**:

- _¿Tienes frío?_ → Are you cold?
    
- _¿Vive aquí tu amigo?_ → Does your friend live here?
    
- _¿Van al trabajo hoy?_ → Are they going to work today?
