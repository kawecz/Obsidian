📚 **Topic 6️⃣: Expressing Guesses & Assumptions – _¿Qué hora será?_**

📘 **Introduction**

In Spanish, the **simple future tense** isn't just used for talking about what _will_ happen. It also plays a special role in expressing **probability, conjecture, or assumptions about the present**. This use—called the **futuro de probabilidad**—allows speakers to make educated guesses or wonder about uncertain facts, like the **time, someone’s age, or location**, all using the _future tense_. It adds **nuance and speculation** to language that goes beyond certainty. 🔮🧠🕰️
