**Explanation:**

In French, **quantity expressions** like _beaucoup de_, _peu de_, and _assez de_ are used to express **how much** or **how many** of something there is. These expressions are always followed by a **noun without an article** (no _le, la, les_), and the noun is usually in the **singular or plural form** depending on the context.

#### 🚫 Important Rule:

Never use an article (**le, la, les**) after these expressions.  
✅ _beaucoup de livres_  
❌ _beaucoup des livres_

If the noun is **preceded by an adjective** and **used without a verb**, the structure may change to **de + adjective + noun**  
✅ _beaucoup de bons films_

#### 🧠 Tip for Plural & Singular:

- Use **plural** when the noun is countable: _beaucoup de pommes_ (a lot of apples)
    
- Use **singular** when it's uncountable: _peu de lait_ (little milk)
