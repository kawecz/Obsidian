### 🎯 Introduction

Articles in French indicate the gender, number, and definiteness of nouns. Choosing the right article is essential because **all French nouns have a gender** (masculine or feminine) and can be singular or plural. There are two main types: **definite** (specific) and **indefinite** (general).

### 🧱 Definite Articles – “The”

Used to refer to **specific** people or things.

|Article|Gender & Number|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**le**|masculine, singular|le livre (the book)|
|**la**|feminine, singular|la table (the table)|
|**l’**|before vowel or silent _h_|l’ami, l’école|
|**les**|plural (both genders)|les enfants (the children)|

📝 Use when: the noun is known, already mentioned, or unique (e.g., _le soleil_ – the sun).

### 🧱 Indefinite Articles – “A / Some”

Used to refer to **unspecified** people or things.

|Article|Gender & Number|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**un**|masculine, singular|un chien (a dog)|
|**une**|feminine, singular|une chaise (a chair)|
|**des**|plural (both genders)|des pommes (some apples)|

📝 Use when: introducing something for the first time, or talking generally.

### 🧠 Gender Notes

- No visual clue for gender—must **memorize** with each noun.
    
- Use a trick: learn nouns **with** their articles from the start (e.g., _le stylo_, _la maison_).

### 🧠 Plural Notes

- Plural nouns **always use "les" or "des"**, regardless of gender.
    
- Final _s_ in plural is **usually silent**: _les chats_ → [le ʃa]

### 🧠 Article Omission

- French **uses articles more often** than English.
    
    - English: I like music.
        
    - French: _J’aime **la** musique._
