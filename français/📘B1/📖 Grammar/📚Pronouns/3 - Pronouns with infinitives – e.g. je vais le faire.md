**Explanation:**

In French, when a **conjugated verb** is followed by an **infinitive**, object pronouns related to the infinitive are placed **before the infinitive**, not before the conjugated verb. This rule helps keep the sentence clear and the pronouns close to the verb they refer to.

#### üß± Basic Structure:

|---|---|---|
|Subject + conjugated verb|First|_Je vais_|
|Object pronoun|Immediately before the infinitive|_le_|
|Infinitive|Last|_faire_|

‚û°Ô∏è **Je vais le faire.** (I am going to do it.)

#### ‚ùó Important Notes:

- The pronoun always comes **just before** the infinitive verb it refers to.
    
- When there is **no infinitive**, pronouns come before the **conjugated verb** (_Je le fais_ = I do it).
    
- In negative sentences, the negation surrounds the conjugated verb, **not** the infinitive or pronoun:  
    _Je ne vais pas le faire._ (I am not going to do it.)
