### üìö Introduction

In Russian, nouns, pronouns, and adjectives change their form depending on their role in a sentence. This is called declension, and it is achieved through the use of six grammatical cases. The cases indicate the function of a word within the sentence, such as whether it is the subject, the object, or showing possession. Learning the cases is essential for understanding Russian syntax and sentence structure.

Each case has a specific function and is used with particular prepositions or to show relationships between words in a sentence. In this section, we'll explore the six cases, their uses, and how to form them with nouns and adjectives.

### üîë 1 - Nominative Case (–ò–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence‚Äîthe noun that is performing the action.

**Examples**:

- **–ú–∞–º–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî Mom is reading a book. (–ú–∞–º–∞ is the subject)
    
- **–°—Ç–æ–ª —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –≤ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–µ.** ‚Äî The table is in the room. (–°—Ç–æ–ª is the subject)
    

**Key Use**: It answers the question **"Who?"** or **"What?"**.

### üß™ 2 - Genitive Case (–†–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The genitive case shows possession, quantity, or negation. It can be translated as "of" or "from" in English.

**Examples**:

- **–£ –º–µ–Ω—è –Ω–µ—Ç –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏.** ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have a book. (–ù–µ—Ç + genitive case)
    
- **–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω—ã.** ‚Äî Marina‚Äôs book. (Genitive to show possession)
    

**Key Use**: It answers the question **"Whose?"** or **"Of whom?"**.

### üß† 3 - Dative Case (–î–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The dative case is used to indicate the indirect object of a sentence, or to whom/for whom something is done.

**Examples**:

- **–Ø –¥–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É –±—Ä–∞—Ç—É.** ‚Äî I give the book to my brother. (–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—É is the dative)
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ –ø–∏—à–µ—Ç –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–µ.** ‚Äî She is writing a letter to her friend. (–ü–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–µ is the dative)
    

**Key Use**: It answers the question **"To whom?"** or **"For whom?"**.

### üîó 4 - Accusative Case (–í–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence‚Äîthe noun that is directly affected by the action.

**Examples**:

- **–Ø –≤–∏–∂—É –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî I see the book. (–ö–Ω–∏–≥—É is the accusative)
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ –∫—É–ø–∏–ª–∞ –Ω–æ–≤—É—é –º–∞—à–∏–Ω—É.** ‚Äî She bought a new car. (–ú–∞—à–∏–Ω—É is the accusative)
    

**Key Use**: It answers the question **"Whom?"** or **"What?"**.

### üß™ 5 - Instrumental Case (–¢–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The instrumental case shows the means or instrument by which an action is performed. It is also used to indicate accompaniment.

**Examples**:

- **–Ø –ø–∏—à—É —Ä—É—á–∫–æ–π.** ‚Äî I write with a pen. (–†—É—á–∫–æ–π is the instrumental)
    
- **–ú—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º —Å –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–º.** ‚Äî We are talking with a friend. (–î—Ä—É–≥–æ–º is the instrumental)
    

**Key Use**: It answers the question **"With what?"** or **"By whom?"**.

### üß† 6 - Prepositional Case (–ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The prepositional case is used to indicate location or the topic of discussion. It is used with certain prepositions like **–≤, –Ω–∞, –æ, –æ–±**.

**Examples**:

- **–Ø –∂–∏–≤—É –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ.** ‚Äî I live in Moscow. (–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ is the prepositional)
    
- **–ú—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º –æ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ.** ‚Äî We are talking about the book. (–ö–Ω–∏–≥–µ is the prepositional)
    

**Key Use**: It answers the question **"Where?"** or **"About whom/what?"**.

### üéØ Conclusion

The Russian language has six cases, each serving a specific function in sentence construction. Understanding and mastering the cases is a key step in acquiring Russian grammar, as it helps convey meaning by showing how words relate to one another in a sentence. Once you become familiar with the cases and their corresponding prepositions, you'll be able to express yourself more precisely and fluently in Russian.
