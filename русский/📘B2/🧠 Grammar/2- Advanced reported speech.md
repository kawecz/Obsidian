|üá∑üá∫ Topic|2 - Advanced Reported Speech in Russian (–ö–æ—Å–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ä–µ—á—å)|
|---|---|

### üìö Introduction

**Reported speech (–∫–æ—Å–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ä–µ—á—å)** in Russian is used to **indirectly relay** what someone has said, thought, or asked. Unlike direct speech, which quotes the exact words, reported speech **paraphrases** the original statement. This requires changes in **pronouns, verb forms, and sometimes word order**. Mastering reported speech is essential for fluent storytelling, reporting events, and discussing past conversations.

### üîë 1 - Key Differences Between Direct and Reported Speech

|Direct Speech (–ü—Ä—è–º–∞—è —Ä–µ—á—å)|Reported Speech (–ö–æ—Å–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ä–µ—á—å)|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: ¬´–Ø —É—Å—Ç–∞–ª¬ª.|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω —É—Å—Ç–∞–ª.|He said, "I am tired." ‚Üí He said that he was tired.|
|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞: ¬´–¢—ã —É–∂–µ –µ–ª?¬ª|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞, –µ–ª –ª–∏ —è —É–∂–µ.|She asked, "Have you eaten?" ‚Üí She asked if I had eaten.|
|–ú–∞–º–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞: ¬´–ü–æ–º–æ–≥–∏ –º–Ω–µ¬ª.|–ú–∞–º–∞ –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–º–æ—á—å –µ–π.|Mom said, "Help me." ‚Üí Mom asked me to help her.|

### üß† 2 - Verb Changes in Reported Speech

In Russian, verbs in reported speech often shift **from present to past** and **from future to conditional**.

|Direct Speech|Reported Speech|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–û–Ω –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç: ¬´–Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç¬ª.|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –ª—é–±–∏—Ç —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç.|He says, "I love sports." ‚Üí He said that he loves sports.|
|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞: ¬´–Ø —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—é¬ª.|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª–∞.|She said, "I am working." ‚Üí She said that she was working.|
|–û–Ω–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏: ¬´–ú—ã –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë–º –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞¬ª.|–û–Ω–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–¥—É—Ç –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞.|They said, "We will come tomorrow." ‚Üí They said that they would come tomorrow.|

‚ö† **Notice:** If the statement is still **true**, present tense can remain in reported speech:  
‚û° –û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ —Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∏—Ç. (_He said that the sun shines._)

### üîÑ 3 - Pronoun and Time Expression Changes

When converting to reported speech, pronouns and time expressions may need adjustment.

#### üîπ Pronoun Changes

|Direct Speech|Reported Speech|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–Ø —É—Å—Ç–∞–ª.|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ **–æ–Ω** —É—Å—Ç–∞–ª.|"I am tired." ‚Üí He said that **he** was tired.|
|–ú—ã –ø–æ–µ–¥–µ–º.|–û–Ω–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ **–æ–Ω–∏** –ø–æ–µ–¥—É—Ç.|"We will go." ‚Üí They said that **they** would go.|

#### üîπ Time Expression Changes

|Direct Speech|Reported Speech|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|—Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è (today)|–≤ —Ç–æ—Ç –¥–µ–Ω—å (that day)|She said, "I will come **today**." ‚Üí She said she would come **that day**.|
|–≤—á–µ—Ä–∞ (yesterday)|–Ω–∞–∫–∞–Ω—É–Ω–µ / –ø—Ä–µ–¥—ã–¥—É—â–∏–º –¥–Ω—ë–º (the previous day)|He said, "I was there **yesterday**." ‚Üí He said he had been there **the previous day**.|
|–∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ (tomorrow)|–Ω–∞ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–π –¥–µ–Ω—å (the next day)|They said, "We will go **tomorrow**." ‚Üí They said they would go **the next day**.|

### üó£Ô∏è 4 - Reported Questions

#### üîπ Yes/No Questions (–ª–∏)

For **yes/no questions**, we use **–ª–∏** (if/whether) in reported speech.

|Direct Speech|Reported Speech|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞: ¬´–¢—ã —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤?¬ª|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞, **—Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤ –ª–∏ —è**.|She asked, "Are you happy?" ‚Üí She asked if I was happy.|
|–û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª: ¬´–¢—ã –≤–∏–¥–µ–ª —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º?¬ª|–û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª, **–≤–∏–¥–µ–ª –ª–∏ —è —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º**.|He asked, "Did you see the movie?" ‚Üí He asked if I had seen the movie.|

#### üîπ Wh- Questions (–ö—Ç–æ, –ß—Ç–æ, –ì–¥–µ, –ö–∞–∫)

For **wh-questions**, we **keep the question word**, but change the sentence structure.

|Direct Speech|Reported Speech|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª: ¬´–ì–¥–µ —Ç—ã –±—ã–ª?¬ª|–û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª, **–≥–¥–µ —è –±—ã–ª**.|He asked, "Where were you?" ‚Üí He asked where I had been.|
|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞: ¬´–ö–∞–∫ —Ç—ã —ç—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª?¬ª|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞, **–∫–∞–∫ —è —ç—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª**.|She asked, "How did you do that?" ‚Üí She asked how I had done that.|

### üéØ Conclusion

Advanced reported speech in Russian requires transformations in **verbs, pronouns, and time expressions**. Pay attention to **tense shifts**, use **–ª–∏** for yes/no questions, and maintain **question words** for wh-questions. Mastering reported speech allows for more natural and complex communication, whether in writing or conversation.
