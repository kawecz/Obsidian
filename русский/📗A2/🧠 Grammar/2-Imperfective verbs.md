## üîÑ Introduction

In Russian, verbs come in **pairs** that express either **ongoing/incomplete** or **completed** actions. **Imperfective verbs** (_–Ω–µ—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤–∏–¥_) describe **unfinished, repeated, habitual, or ongoing actions**. They answer the question **‚ÄúWhat was/is/will be happening?‚Äù** ‚Äî not whether it was completed.

Imperfective verbs are essential for everyday conversation, describing processes, and talking about routines.

## üìò When to Use Imperfective Verbs

|Usage|Example in Russian|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Ongoing action|_–Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É._|I‚Äôm reading a book.|
|Habit / repetition|_–û–Ω —Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –≤ —à–∫–æ–ª—É –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å._|He goes to school every day.|
|Process or duration|_–ú—ã —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –≤–µ—Å—å –¥–µ–Ω—å._|We were working all day.|
|General statement|_–Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å._|I love cooking.|
|With ‚Äúwhen‚Äù (_–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞_) in the past|_–ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è —É—á–∏–ª—Å—è, —è —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ._|When I was studying, I read a lot.|

## üßæ Key Characteristics

- Imperfective verbs **can be used in all tenses**: past, present, and future.
    
- Their **perfective partners** are used only when the action is completed.
    

|Tense|Verb|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Present|_–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_|_–Ø –¥–µ–ª–∞—é –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω–µ–µ –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ._ (I‚Äôm doing homework.)|
|Past|_–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_|_–û–Ω –¥–µ–ª–∞–ª —ç—Ç–æ –≤—á–µ—Ä–∞._ (He was doing it yesterday.)|
|Future (long form)|_–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_|_–Ø –±—É–¥—É –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞._ (I will be doing it tomorrow.)|

> To express future with imperfective, use **"–±—É–¥—É + infinitive"**: _–±—É–¥—É —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å, –±—É–¥–µ—à—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å, –±—É–¥–µ–º —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å._

## üó£Ô∏è Example Sentences

- _–ú—ã —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ –≥—É–ª—è–µ–º –≤ –ø–∞—Ä–∫–µ._ ‚Äì We often walk in the park.
    
- _–Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª —ç—Ç—É –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É –≤ –¥–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ._ ‚Äì I used to read this book as a child.
    
- _–û–Ω–∞ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —É—á–∏—Ç—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π._ ‚Äì She will be studying Russian.
    
- _–¢—ã —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—à—å —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å?_ ‚Äì Are you working now?
    

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- Using imperfective when you mean a **finished action**:
    
    - _–Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. ‚ùå_ ‚Üí _–Ø –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. ‚úÖ_ (if it's finished)
        
- Forgetting that imperfective verbs **cannot** express a one-time completed result.
    

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**Imperfective verbs** are used for describing actions that are **ongoing, repeated, or general**. They‚Äôre flexible and used across **all tenses**, unlike perfective verbs. Learning to recognize and use imperfective verbs helps express everyday actions, habits, and processes clearly and naturally in Russian.
