### üìö Introduction

In Russian, **object pronouns** and **demonstrative pronouns** replace nouns and must agree in gender, number, and case with the words they refer to. This agreement is crucial for ensuring clarity and grammatical correctness. In this lesson, we‚Äôll focus on how these pronouns function and change based on their grammatical role in the sentence.

### üéØ 1 - Object Pronouns (–û–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ–∏–º–µ–Ω–∏—è)

These pronouns take the place of a direct or indirect object in the sentence. They decline by case and must match the **person** and **number** of the noun they replace.

|Case|—è (I)|—Ç—ã (you)|–æ–Ω (he/it)|–æ–Ω–∞ (she/it)|–º—ã (we)|–≤—ã (you)|–æ–Ω–∏ (they)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Accusative|–º–µ–Ω—è|—Ç–µ–±—è|–µ–≥–æ|–µ—ë|–Ω–∞—Å|–≤–∞—Å|–∏—Ö|
|Dative|–º–Ω–µ|—Ç–µ–±–µ|–µ–º—É|–µ–π|–Ω–∞–º|–≤–∞–º|–∏–º|
|Genitive|–º–µ–Ω—è|—Ç–µ–±—è|–µ–≥–æ|–µ—ë|–Ω–∞—Å|–≤–∞—Å|–∏—Ö|

**Examples:**

- **–Ø –≤–∏–∂—É –µ—ë.** ‚Äî I see her.
    
- **–û–Ω –¥–∞–ª –º–Ω–µ –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî He gave me a book.
    
- **–û–Ω–∏ –∂–¥—É—Ç –Ω–∞—Å.** ‚Äî They are waiting for us.

### üìå 2 - Demonstrative Pronouns (–£–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ–∏–º–µ–Ω–∏—è)

These are used to point out or emphasize a noun. In Russian, the main demonstrative pronouns are **—ç—Ç–æ—Ç (this)** and **—Ç–æ—Ç (that)**. They behave like adjectives and must agree with the noun in **gender, number, and case**.

|Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Nominative|—ç—Ç–æ—Ç|—ç—Ç–∞|—ç—Ç–æ|—ç—Ç–∏|
|Accusative|—ç—Ç–æ—Ç / —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ*|—ç—Ç—É|—ç—Ç–æ|—ç—Ç–∏ / —ç—Ç–∏—Ö*|
|Dative|—ç—Ç–æ–º—É|—ç—Ç–æ–π|—ç—Ç–æ–º—É|—ç—Ç–∏–º|
|Genitive|—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ|—ç—Ç–æ–π|—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ|—ç—Ç–∏—Ö|

*Animate masculine and plural forms take genitive endings in accusative.

**Examples:**

- **–Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é —ç—Ç—É –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî I love this book.
    
- **–¢—ã –≤–∏–¥–µ–ª —Ç–æ–≥–æ –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω—É?** ‚Äî Did you see that man?
    
- **–ú—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º –æ–± —ç—Ç–∏—Ö —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ö.** ‚Äî We‚Äôre talking about these students.

### üß† 3 - Agreement Rules

- Object pronouns do **not agree** with the object but change by case depending on the verb.
    
- Demonstrative pronouns **must agree** in **gender**, **number**, and **case** with the noun they describe.
    
- When used together, the sentence must maintain consistent agreement across all components.
    

**Example:**

- **–Ø –¥–∞–ª —ç—Ç—É –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É –µ–º—É.** ‚Äî I gave _this book_ to _him_.
    
    - _—ç—Ç—É_ agrees with _–∫–Ω–∏–≥—É_ (feminine, accusative)
        
    - _–µ–º—É_ is dative, singular, masculine/neuter (indirect object)

### üéØ Conclusion

Object and demonstrative pronouns are essential tools in Russian that require careful use of case, gender, and number agreement. Object pronouns change depending on their syntactic role, while demonstrative pronouns must match the nouns they describe. Mastering their forms and agreements ensures clear and accurate communication.
