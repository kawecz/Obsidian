### üìö Introduction

In Russian, forming questions involves using question words. These words are used to inquire about specific information, like "who," "what," "where," "how," and "why." The structure of questions in Russian is slightly different from English, and the word order or intonation often indicates whether a sentence is a question.

### üîë 1 - Basic Question Words

|English|Russian|Pronunciation|
|---|---|---|
|Who|–∫—Ç–æ|kto|
|What|—á—Ç–æ|chto|
|Where|–≥–¥–µ|gde|
|How|–∫–∞–∫|kak|
|Why|–ø–æ—á–µ–º—É|pochemu|

These words are used to ask about people, objects, places, actions, reasons, etc.

### üß™ 2 - Question Structures

#### 1) **Who?** (–∫—Ç–æ)

Used to ask about a person or a subject.

- **–ö—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ?** ‚Äî Who is this?
    
- **–ö—Ç–æ –æ–Ω?** ‚Äî Who is he?
    

#### 2) **What?** (—á—Ç–æ)

Used to ask about things, actions, or to request information.

- **–ß—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ?** ‚Äî What is this?
    
- **–ß—Ç–æ —Ç—ã –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—à—å?** ‚Äî What are you doing?
    

#### 3) **Where?** (–≥–¥–µ)

Used to inquire about locations.

- **–ì–¥–µ —Ç—ã –±—ã–ª?** ‚Äî Where were you?
    
- **–ì–¥–µ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞?** ‚Äî Where is the library?
    

#### 4) **How?** (–∫–∞–∫)

Used to inquire about manner, condition, or quality.

- **–ö–∞–∫ —Ç—ã?** ‚Äî How are you?
    
- **–ö–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?** ‚Äî How to do this?
    

#### 5) **Why?** (–ø–æ—á–µ–º—É)

Used to ask for a reason or explanation.

- **–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É —Ç—ã –æ–ø–æ–∑–¥–∞–ª?** ‚Äî Why are you late?
    
- **–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É —ç—Ç–æ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ?** ‚Äî Why is this important?

### üß† 3 - Question Formation with Word Order

In Russian, questions can often be formed by simply raising intonation at the end of a statement, much like in English. However, **question words** are typically placed at the beginning of the sentence. The **word order** can change slightly depending on the type of question.

|Statement (affirmative)|Question (interrogative)|
|---|---|
|–¢—ã –¥–æ–º–∞. (You are at home.)|–¢—ã –¥–æ–º–∞? (Are you at home?)|
|–û–Ω —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç. (He works.)|–û–Ω —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç? (Does he work?)|

With **question words**, the structure remains similar but the question word is placed at the start:

|Russian Question|English Translation|
|---|---|
|**–ö—Ç–æ** —ç—Ç–æ?|**Who** is this?|
|**–ß—Ç–æ** —Ç—ã —Ö–æ—á–µ—à—å?|**What** do you want?|
|**–ì–¥–µ** —Ç—ã –±—ã–ª?|**Where** were you?|
|**–ö–∞–∫** —Ç—ã —Å–µ–±—è —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—à—å?|**How** do you feel?|
|**–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É** —Ç—ã –æ–ø–æ–∑–¥–∞–ª?|**Why** are you late?|

### üîó 4 - Yes/No Questions

Yes/No questions in Russian are formed with a simple **intonation change** and do not require a question word. The verb **appears before the subject**, like in English "Are you...?" or "Is he...?"

- **–¢—ã —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç?** ‚Äî Are you a student?
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏?** ‚Äî Does she speak Russian?

### üéØ Conclusion

Mastering question words in Russian is crucial for forming inquiries in conversation. Understanding how to use **–∫—Ç–æ**, **—á—Ç–æ**, **–≥–¥–µ**, **–∫–∞–∫**, and **–ø–æ—á–µ–º—É** will allow you to gather information and deepen conversations. The sentence structure is flexible, with question words placed at the beginning and a change in intonation signaling a question.
