### üìö Introduction

The formation of the **Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)** in 1922 marked a monumental transformation in global history. After the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks consolidated power and sought to unite various former territories of the Russian Empire under a single socialist state. The USSR became the world's first constitutionally socialist state, setting the stage for the rise of Soviet communism, the Cold War, and major global ideological shifts throughout the 20th century.

### üéØ Conclusion

The formation of the USSR was a defining moment of the 20th century, shaping not only the fate of the former Russian Empire but also global politics for decades. Although the Soviet Union claimed to be a federation of equal republics, real power was concentrated in the Communist Party and in Moscow. The USSR became a superpower, but its centralization, political repression, and ethnic tensions ultimately contributed to its dissolution in 1991.
