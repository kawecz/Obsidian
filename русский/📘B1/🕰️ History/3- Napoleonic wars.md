### üìö Introduction

The Napoleonic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire and various European coalitions, including Russia. These wars, which lasted from 1803 to 1815, had a significant impact on Europe, reshaping political borders, economies, and alliances. Russia played a crucial role in both the military campaigns and the eventual defeat of Napoleon, particularly during the Russian campaign of 1812.

### üîë 1 - Prelude to War (–ü—Ä–µ–¥—ã—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã)

- **Rise of Napoleon**: After the French Revolution (1789-1799), Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in France, eventually declaring himself Emperor in 1804. His ambition to dominate Europe led to a series of conflicts with various coalitions of European powers.
    
- **Russian Relations with France**: Initially, Russia was part of the Third Coalition against France. However, in 1807, Tsar Alexander I signed the Treaty of Tilsit with Napoleon, aligning Russia with France and recognizing Napoleon‚Äôs control over much of Europe.
    
- **Breakdown of Relations**: Over time, tensions grew between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I. Napoleon's Continental System, which aimed to isolate Britain economically, placed strain on Russia, particularly in terms of trade. Russia eventually broke the alliance with France, leading to the start of the Russian campaign of 1812.

### üß™ 2 - The Russian Campaign of 1812 (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏—è 1812 –≥–æ–¥–∞)

- **Napoleon‚Äôs Invasion**: In June 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia with an army of over 600,000 men, the largest military force ever assembled at the time. Napoleon‚Äôs goal was to force Russia to comply with his Continental System and bring the Russian Empire under his control.
    
- **Russian Strategy**: Tsar Alexander I adopted a scorched-earth strategy, retreating deeper into Russia while destroying supplies and infrastructure to prevent Napoleon‚Äôs army from benefiting from local resources. This tactic would prove devastating to the French.
    
- **The Battle of Borodino**: The largest and bloodiest battle of the Russian campaign occurred at Borodino, where Russian forces fought fiercely against the French. While the battle was technically inconclusive, it inflicted heavy losses on Napoleon‚Äôs forces and delayed his advance.
    
- **Moscow and the Russian Winter**: Napoleon‚Äôs army reached Moscow in September 1812, only to find the city abandoned and largely burned down. As winter approached, Napoleon‚Äôs army was severely weakened by supply shortages, disease, and the brutal Russian cold.

- **The Retreat**: Facing the onset of winter and a lack of supplies, Napoleon was forced to begin his retreat from Moscow in October 1812. The Russian army, alongside guerrilla groups, harassed the retreating French forces, further weakening their morale and effectiveness.
    
- **The Battle of Maloyaroslavets**: During the retreat, Napoleon attempted to fight his way through Russian positions at the Battle of Maloyaroslavets. The battle ended in a French defeat, further hindering Napoleon‚Äôs ability to continue his retreat.
    
- **The End of the Campaign**: By December 1812, Napoleon‚Äôs army was decimated. Of the original 600,000 men, fewer than 100,000 survived the campaign. The catastrophic failure of the Russian campaign marked the beginning of Napoleon‚Äôs downfall.

- **The Invasion of France (1814)**: Russian forces, alongside other Coalition troops, invaded France in 1814. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to the island of Elba.

- **Napoleon‚Äôs Return and Waterloo**: In 1815, Napoleon escaped from exile and returned to France, gathering support for a brief resurgence known as the Hundred Days. However, his final defeat came at the Battle of Waterloo, where British and Prussian forces, aided by Russians, decisively defeated him.
    
- **Congress of Vienna**: After Napoleon‚Äôs final defeat, the victorious powers, including Russia, convened at the Congress of Vienna to redraw the map of Europe. Russia emerged as one of the major powers in Europe, with Tsar Alexander I playing a key role in shaping the post-war order.
    
- **The Russian Role in European Affairs**: The victory over Napoleon solidified Russia‚Äôs status as a major European power. Tsar Alexander I‚Äôs leadership in the defeat of Napoleon and at the Congress of Vienna helped establish Russia‚Äôs influence in European politics for decades to come.
