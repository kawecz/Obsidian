### üìö Introduction

Reflexive verbs are an essential part of the Russian language. These verbs indicate that the subject and the object of the action are the same, meaning the action is being done to oneself. Reflexive verbs in Russian are formed by adding the suffix "-—Å—è" or "-—Å—å" to the base form of the verb. Understanding how to use reflexive verbs is crucial for expressing actions related to oneself, daily routines, and personal experiences.

### üîë 1 - Reflexive Verbs Overview (–†–µ—Ñ–ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ –≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª—ã)

In Russian, reflexive verbs end in "-—Å—è" (for verbs in the infinitive form). The reflexive particle can be used with a wide range of verbs to indicate that the subject performs the action on themselves. When conjugated, the reflexive pronoun changes according to the person and number of the subject.

Here are some examples of common reflexive verbs in Russian:

- **–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è (to dress oneself)**
    
- **–º—ã—Ç—å—Å—è (to wash oneself)**
    
- **–∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞–∫–∞—Ç—å (to have breakfast)**
    
- **—Å–ø–∞—Ç—å—Å—è (to sleep)**
    
- **—É—á–∏—Ç—å—Å—è (to study)**
    
- **–≥–æ—Ä–¥–∏—Ç—å—Å—è (to be proud of oneself)**

Reflexive verbs are conjugated in the same way as non-reflexive verbs, with the addition of a reflexive pronoun depending on the subject. Here are some examples:

- **–Ø –æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—é—Å—å.** ‚Äî I am getting dressed.
    
- **–¢—ã –º–æ–µ—à—å—Å—è.** ‚Äî You are washing yourself.
    
- **–û–Ω —É—á–∏—Ç—Å—è.** ‚Äî He is studying.
    
- **–ú—ã –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞–∫–∞–µ–º.** ‚Äî We are having breakfast.
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ –≥–æ—Ä–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è —Å–æ–±–æ–π.** ‚Äî She is proud of herself.

### üß† 3 - Reflexive Verbs with Different Meanings (–†–µ—Ñ–ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ –≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª—ã —Å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏)

Some verbs can have different meanings depending on whether they are used reflexively or not. Here are a few examples:

- **–º—ã—Ç—å** (to wash) vs. **–º—ã—Ç—å—Å—è** (to wash oneself)
    
- **–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å** (to dress someone) vs. **–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è** (to dress oneself)
    
- **—Å–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞—Ç—å** (to collect) vs. **—Å–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞—Ç—å—Å—è** (to prepare or plan to do something)
    

For example:

- **–Ø –º–æ—é –ø–æ—Å—É–¥—É.** ‚Äî I am washing the dishes. (not reflexive)
    
- **–Ø –º–æ—é—Å—å.** ‚Äî I am washing myself. (reflexive)

Reflexive verbs are conjugated in the past tense by adding the appropriate past tense form of the verb to the reflexive pronoun:

- **–Ø –æ–¥–µ–≤–∞ÃÅ–ª—Å—è/–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞ÃÅ–ª–∞—Å—å.** ‚Äî I was dressing (masculine/feminine).
    
- **–¢—ã –º—ã–ª—Å—è/–º—ã–ª–∞—Å—å.** ‚Äî You were washing yourself (masculine/feminine).
    
- **–û–Ω —É—á–∏ÃÅ–ª—Å—è.** ‚Äî He was studying.
    

Note that the reflexive pronoun "-—Å—è" changes based on gender and number in the past tense.
