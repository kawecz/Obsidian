|🇷🇺 Topic|2 - Noun Gender in Russian (Род существительных)|
|---|---|

### 📚 Introduction

Russian nouns are classified into **three grammatical genders**: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Unlike in English, every noun has a gender, and this affects **adjective agreement**, **verb past tense endings**, and **pronoun usage**. Learning how to identify the gender of a noun is crucial for grammatical accuracy.
