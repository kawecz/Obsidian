### 🔡 The Alphabet (L’alphabet français)

- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
    
- All letters are the same as English, **but pronounced differently**.
    
- Example pronunciation:
    
    - **A** – /a/ (like "ah")
        
    - **E** – /ə/ or silent (very tricky!)
        
    - **G** – /ʒ/ before E or I (like "genre")
        
    - **H** – always _silent_ in French
        
    - **R** – guttural /ʁ/ from the throat
        
    - **U** – /y/, a sound that doesn’t exist in English

### ✨ Accents (Les accents)

1. **L’accent aigu (é)** – changes _e_ to a clear /e/ sound (e.g., _école_)
    
2. **L’accent grave (è, à, ù)** – makes _e_ an open /ɛ/ (e.g., _père_)
    
3. **L’accent circonflexe (ê, â, etc.)** – usually indicates a historical _s_ (e.g., _forêt_)
    
4. **La cédille (ç)** – makes _c_ soft like _s_ (e.g., _garçon_)
    
5. **Le tréma (ë, ï, ü)** – separates vowel sounds (e.g., _Noël_)

### 🗣️ Key Pronunciation Rules

- **Final consonants** are often **silent**: _petit_, _grand_, _parlez_
    
- **Liaison**: When a usually silent consonant is pronounced before a vowel.
    
    - _Les amis_ → /lez‿ami/
        
- **Nasal vowels**: Don't pronounce the final _n/m_, air goes through the nose:
    
    - _an_, _en_, _in_, _on_, _un_ → /ɑ̃/, /ɛ̃/, /ɔ̃/, etc.
        
- **Letter combinations**:
    
    - **Ch** → /ʃ/ (_chat_)
        
    - **Gn** → /ɲ/ (_montagne_)
        
    - **Ou** → /u/ (_fou_)

### 🧠 Pronunciation Tips

- Pay attention to **rhythm and flow**, French is **syllable-timed**.
