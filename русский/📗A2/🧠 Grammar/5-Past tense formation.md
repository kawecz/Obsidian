## üîô Introduction

The **past tense** in Russian is used to describe actions or states that happened or existed in the past. It is formed differently than in English, as Russian verbs do not conjugate by person in the past tense but agree in **gender** and **number** with the subject.

## üìò How to Form the Past Tense

1. Start with the **infinitive** of the verb (e.g., _–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_ ‚Äî to do).
    
2. Remove the infinitive ending **-—Ç—å** (or **-—Ç–∏**).
    
3. Add the appropriate **past tense ending** according to the gender and number of the subject:
    

|Gender / Number|Ending|Example with _–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_ (to do)|Translation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Masculine|-–ª|_–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª_|He did|
|Feminine|-–ª–∞|_–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∞_|She did|
|Neuter|-–ª–æ|_–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–æ_|It did|
|Plural|-–ª–∏|_–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏_|They did|

> For many verbs, before adding these endings, you remove **-—Ç—å** from the infinitive, sometimes with minor stem changes depending on verb conjugation type.

## üßæ Examples

|Infinitive|Past Masculine|Past Feminine|Past Neuter|Past Plural|English Translation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å|–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª|–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∞|–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–æ|–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∏|wrote|
|—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å|—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª|—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∞|—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–æ|—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏|read|
|–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å|–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª|–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∞|–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–æ|–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏|did|
|–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å|–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª|–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∞|–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª–æ|–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∏|spoke|

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The past tense verb agrees with the **subject‚Äôs gender and number**, not person.
    
- With **plural subjects**, use **-–ª–∏** regardless of gender.
    
- Past tense verbs are often used with **–±—ã** to form the conditional mood (_—è –±—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª_ ‚Äî I would do).
    

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Russian past tense is simple to form by adding gender- and number-specific endings to the verb stem. It does not change with person, making it easier once you learn the endings. Practicing with common verbs will help you use the past tense naturally in conversation and writing.
