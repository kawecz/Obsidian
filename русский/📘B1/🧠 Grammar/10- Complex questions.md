### üìö Introduction

Complex questions in Russian go beyond simple yes/no queries. They involve **question words** (who, what, where, when, why, how) and often **subordinate clauses** to gather more detailed information. Just like in English, these questions can be direct or indirect and may involve different **word orders**, **tenses**, and **cases** depending on the context. In this lesson, we'll break down the structure of complex questions in Russian and how to form them properly.

### ‚ùì 1 - Basic Question Words (–í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞)

|Russian|English|
|---|---|
|–∫—Ç–æ|who|
|—á—Ç–æ|what|
|–≥–¥–µ|where|
|–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞|when|
|–ø–æ—á–µ–º—É|why|
|–∫–∞–∫|how|
|–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π|which|

These words are often used at the **beginning** of complex questions.

### üîç 2 - Direct Complex Questions

These are questions where you directly ask for detailed information.

**Structure:**  
**[Question word] + [Subject] + [Verb] (+ Object/Complement)**

**Examples:**

- **–ì–¥–µ —Ç—ã –∂–∏–≤—ë—à—å?** ‚Äî Where do you live?
    
- **–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É –æ–Ω –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏—à—ë–ª?** ‚Äî Why didn‚Äôt he come?
    
- **–ö–∞–∫ —Ç—ã —É—á–∏—à—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π?** ‚Äî How do you study Russian?
    
- **–ß—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞ —Ç–µ–±–µ?** ‚Äî What did she say to you?

### üîÑ 3 - Indirect Complex Questions

Indirect questions are embedded in larger statements or other questions.

**Structure:**  
**[Main Clause] + [Question Word] + [Subordinate Clause]**

**Examples:**

- **–Ø –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é, –≥–¥–µ –æ–Ω –∂–∏–≤—ë—Ç.** ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know where he lives.
    
- **–°–∫–∞–∂–∏ –º–Ω–µ, –ø–æ—á–µ–º—É —Ç—ã –æ–ø–æ–∑–¥–∞–ª.** ‚Äî Tell me why you were late.
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–∞—á–Ω—ë—Ç—Å—è —É—Ä–æ–∫.** ‚Äî She asked when the lesson would start.
    

**Note:** In indirect questions, the word order stays like a statement (Subject + Verb), unlike English.

### üß© 4 - Verb Tense and Word Order in Complex Questions

In **direct questions**, inversion is common (verb follows the question word), especially in speech:

- **–ß—Ç–æ —Ç—ã –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—à—å?** ‚Äî What are you doing?
    

In **indirect questions**, Russian follows a **normal declarative word order**, not question format:

- **–Ø –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é, —á—Ç–æ —Ç—ã –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—à—å.** ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what you are doing.

### üéØ Conclusion

Complex questions in Russian rely on question words and proper word order depending on whether the question is **direct** or **indirect**. While direct questions often resemble English structure, indirect questions follow typical **statement order**. Learning to use these forms allows for clearer, more sophisticated communication in Russian.
