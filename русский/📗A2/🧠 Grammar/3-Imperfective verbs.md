### üìö Introduction

In Russian, verbs are categorized into two main aspects: imperfective and perfective. The imperfective aspect describes an ongoing, habitual, or repeated action. It‚Äôs used for actions that are in progress, routine, or not yet completed. Understanding imperfective verbs is crucial for expressing actions that occur regularly or are still happening.

Imperfective verbs are formed from their perfective counterparts or can have their own unique base forms. This distinction between imperfective and perfective verbs allows Russian speakers to convey subtle differences in meaning and time.

Imperfective verbs describe an action that is continuous, habitual, or repeated. These verbs are often used to indicate something that happens over a period of time or an ongoing state.

**Examples**:

- **–Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî I am reading a book. (The action is in progress.)
    
- **–û–Ω —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ –µ–∑–¥–∏—Ç –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—É.** ‚Äî He often travels to Moscow. (A repeated or habitual action.)
    
- **–ú—ã –≥—É–ª—è–µ–º –≤ –ø–∞—Ä–∫–µ.** ‚Äî We are walking in the park. (An ongoing action.)
    

**Key Use**: The imperfective verb answers the question **"What is happening?"** or **"What happens regularly?"**

Many imperfective verbs are formed by adding prefixes or suffixes to their perfective counterparts. However, some verbs are already imperfective by nature and do not need any modifications.

**Examples of verb pairs**:

- **–†–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å** (to work, imperfective) vs. **–°–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å** (to do, perfective)
    
- **–ß–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å** (to read, imperfective) vs. **–ü—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å** (to read through, perfective)
    
- **–ì–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å** (to speak, imperfective) vs. **–°–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å** (to say, perfective)
    

The **imperfective aspect** focuses on the process or duration of the action, while the **perfective aspect** refers to the completion of an action.

### üß† 3 - Use of Imperfective Verbs in Sentences (–ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–µ—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö)

Imperfective verbs are used in various tenses to describe ongoing actions. The most common tenses in which imperfective verbs appear are the **present tense** and **past tense**.

**Examples in present tense**:

- **–Ø —É—á—É —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫.** ‚Äî I am learning Russian. (The action is ongoing.)
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –≤—Å—Ç–∞–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–Ω–æ.** ‚Äî She always wakes up early. (A habitual action.)
    

**Examples in past tense**:

- **–û–Ω —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É –≤–µ—Å—å –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä.** ‚Äî He was reading the book all evening. (The action was ongoing in the past.)
    
- **–ú—ã –≥—É–ª—è–ª–∏ –ø–æ –ø–∞—Ä–∫—É.** ‚Äî We were walking in the park. (An ongoing action in the past.)

1. **For ongoing actions**:
    
    - **–Ø –ø–∏—à—É –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ.** ‚Äî I am writing a letter.
        
    - This verb shows the process of the action, indicating that it is still happening.
        
2. **For habitual actions**:
    
    - **–û–Ω –±–µ–≥–∞–µ—Ç –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–µ —É—Ç—Ä–æ.** ‚Äî He runs every morning.
        
    - This shows a repeated or regular action.
        
3. **For describing a state**:
    
    - **–û–Ω–∞ –±—ã–ª–∞ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤–∞.** ‚Äî She was happy.
        
    - In this case, the verb **–±—ã–ª–∞** (was) indicates a state of being.
