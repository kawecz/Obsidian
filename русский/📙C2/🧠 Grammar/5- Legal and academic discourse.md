## üìö **Introduction**

**Legal and academic discourse** in Russian refers to the specialized language used in legal contexts and scholarly environments. Both forms of discourse are characterized by precision, formality, and clarity, requiring a deep understanding of specific terminology and syntactic structures. Legal discourse deals with laws, regulations, and judicial processes, while academic discourse encompasses scholarly discussions, research, and formal writing. Both domains use specialized vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and a formal tone that differentiates them from everyday conversation. Mastery of legal and academic discourse is crucial for anyone engaging with these fields, whether through reading, writing, or speaking in professional or academic settings.

## üîë **Key Concepts in Legal and Academic Discourse**

|**Concept**|**Description**|**Example**|**Emoji**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Formal Syntax and Structure (–§–æ—Ä–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏—Å –∏ —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞)**|Legal and academic texts often use long, complex sentences with nested clauses. These structures provide clarity and precision, but they require careful attention to syntax.|_"–í —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ —Å –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º, –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ –æ–±—è–∑–∞–Ω—ã –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è—Ç—å —Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è, —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∞–º–∏ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏."_ (_In accordance with the law, citizens are required to comply with the demands set by the authorities._)|üìú|
|**Technical Terminology (–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è)**|Both legal and academic discourse use specialized vocabulary that may not be familiar in everyday speech.

|**Use of Passive Voice (–ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–ª–æ–≥–∞)**|Passive constructions are prevalent in both legal and academic discourse as they emphasize actions or results rather than the subject performing the action.|_"–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç –±—ã–ª –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º."_ (_The document was signed by the chairman._)|üîÑ|
|**Impersonal Constructions (–ë–µ–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏)**|Impersonal constructions are often used to avoid assigning specific responsibility or subject to a statement, particularly in academic writing or legal documents where neutrality is important.|_"–û–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω –≤ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–º –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ."_ (_It is expected that the result will be obtained next month._)|‚öñÔ∏è|
