### üìö Introduction

In Russian, conjunctions play a crucial role in connecting clauses and ideas within complex and compound sentences. These conjunctions fall into two main categories:

- **Coordinating conjunctions (—Å–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—é–∑—ã)** ‚Äî connect **equal** parts (two independent clauses or words of the same function)
    
- **Subordinating conjunctions (–ø–æ–¥—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—é–∑—ã)** ‚Äî connect a **main clause** with a **dependent clause**
    

Mastering these conjunctions helps in constructing long, fluent, and logically structured sentences in Russian.

### üß± 1 - Coordinating Conjunctions (–°–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—é–∑—ã)

These conjunctions link **equal grammatical units**: two main clauses, subjects, verbs, or objects.

|Russian|English|Usage|
|---|---|---|
|–∏|and|Adding information|
|–Ω–æ|but|Contrasting|
|–∏–ª–∏|or|Offering alternatives|
|–∞|whereas / but|Contrast with a twist|
|–æ–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ|however|Contrasting in formal speech|
|—Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ|also|Adding to previous clause|

**Examples:**

- **–Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É, –∏ –æ–Ω–∞ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è.** ‚Äî I‚Äôm reading a book, and it‚Äôs very interesting.
    
- **–û–Ω –ª—é–±–∏—Ç —á–∞–π, –Ω–æ —è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–æ—Ñ–µ.** ‚Äî He likes tea, but I prefer coffee.

### üîó 2 - Subordinating Conjunctions (–ü–æ–¥—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—é–∑—ã)

These introduce **dependent (subordinate)** clauses that cannot stand alone.

|Russian|English|Type|
|---|---|---|
|–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ|because|Cause|
|–µ—Å–ª–∏|if|Condition|
|–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞|when|Time|
|—Ö–æ—Ç—è|although|Concession|
|—á—Ç–æ–±—ã|in order to / so that|Purpose|
|—Ç–∞–∫ –∫–∞–∫|since|Cause|
|–ø–æ–∫–∞|while / as long as|Time|

**Examples:**

- **–Ø –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è –¥–æ–º–∞, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ —à—ë–ª –¥–æ–∂–¥—å.** ‚Äî I stayed home because it was raining.
    
- **–ï—Å–ª–∏ –æ–Ω –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—Ç, –º—ã –Ω–∞—á–Ω—ë–º —É—Ä–æ–∫.** ‚Äî If he comes, we‚Äôll start the lesson.
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ —É—á–∏—Ç —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∂–∏—Ç—å –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏.** ‚Äî She‚Äôs learning Russian to live in Russia.

### üß† 3 - Building Long Sentences

To build longer sentences, you can **combine multiple conjunctions** from both categories. Make sure to match the **case**, **tense**, and **word order** correctly for each clause.

**Example:**

- **–ï—Å–ª–∏ –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞, –º—ã –ø–æ–µ–¥–µ–º –Ω–∞ –¥–∞—á—É, –∏ —è –≤–æ–∑—å–º—É —Å —Å–æ–±–æ–π –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–µ.**  
    ‚Üí If the weather is good tomorrow, we will go to the dacha, and I‚Äôll take a book with me to read in nature.

### üéØ Conclusion

Using coordinating and subordinating conjunctions correctly allows you to create fluent, logically connected sentences. Coordinating conjunctions join equal ideas, while subordinating conjunctions connect dependent thoughts to main ones. These tools are essential for constructing long, expressive sentences in both speech and writing.
