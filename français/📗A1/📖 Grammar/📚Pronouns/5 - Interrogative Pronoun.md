### ðŸ§  Introduction

In French, **interrogative pronouns** are used to ask **questions about people or things**, but **they replace the noun** instead of accompanying it. They are useful when you donâ€™t want to repeat the noun in the question.

### ðŸ§© Structure & Usage

#### 1. **Qui / Que / Quoi**

- **Qui** is used for people as a **subject or object**.
    
- **Que (Quâ€™)** is used for things as a **direct object** (before a verb).
    
- **Quoi** is used **after prepositions** or in **informal speech**.
    

âœ… _Examples:_

- **Qui** est lÃ  ? â†’ Who is there?
    
- **Que** fais-tu ? â†’ What are you doing?
    
- Tu penses Ã  **quoi** ? â†’ What are you thinking about?
    

#### 2. **Lequel / Laquelle / Lesquels / Lesquelles**

These replace **a noun already mentioned** and must agree in **gender and number**. Often used with prepositions like _Ã _, _de_:

âœ… _Examples:_

- Le livre **dans lequel** jâ€™Ã©cris â†’ The book **in which** I write
    
- **Lesquelles** de ces robes prÃ©fÃ¨res-tu ? â†’ Which ones of these dresses do you prefer?

### ðŸ›‘ Important Notes

- **Que** becomes **quâ€™** before a vowel (e.g., _Quâ€™aime-t-il ?_)
    
- Do not confuse **que** (what) with **quâ€™est-ce que** (what is it that...), which is more common in spoken French.
    
- **Quoi** canâ€™t start a formal question; it usually follows a verb or preposition.

### âœ… Conclusion

French **interrogative pronouns** allow you to ask about people or things **without repeating the noun**. They are vital for both spoken and written questions, and choosing the right form depends on whether you're referring to a person or object, and whether it's the subject or object of the question.
