## üìö **Introduction**

In Russian, **embedded clauses** are dependent clauses that are part of larger sentences. These clauses can add information such as conditions, reasons, or explanations to the main clause. **Formal subordination** refers to the way these clauses are syntactically linked to the main clause using subordinating conjunctions, relative pronouns, or other structures. Mastering embedded clauses and formal subordination is crucial for speaking and writing fluently in Russian.

## üîë **Key Concepts in Embedded Clauses and Formal Subordination**

|**Concept**|**Description**|**Example**|**Emoji**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Embedded Clause**|A dependent clause that is connected to a main clause and cannot stand alone.|_–û–Ω–∞ –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—Ç._ (_She didn‚Äôt know that he was coming._)|üîó|
|**Subordination**|The process of linking a dependent clause to a main clause to create a hierarchy, often with subordinating conjunctions.|_–Ø –ø–æ–π–¥—É, –µ—Å–ª–∏ —Å–º–æ–≥—É._ (_I‚Äôll go if I can._)|üîª|
|**Subordinating Conjunctions**|Words that introduce embedded clauses, showing their relation to the main clause. Common Russian subordinators include "—á—Ç–æ," "–µ—Å–ª–∏," "–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞," "–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ."|_–Ø –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è –¥–æ–º–∞, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ —à—ë–ª –¥–æ–∂–¥—å._ (_I stayed home because it was raining._)|‚û°Ô∏è|
|**Relative Clauses**|Clauses that modify a noun in the main clause, introduced by relative pronouns like "–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π," "–∫—Ç–æ," and "—á—Ç–æ."|_–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é —è –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª, –±—ã–ª–∞ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π._ (_The book that I read was interesting._)|üìö|
|**Formal Subordination**|The use of subordinating conjunctions or relative pronouns to show the dependence of the embedded clause on the main clause.|_–û–Ω–∞ —É—à–ª–∞, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–∞ —É—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞._ (_She left because she was tired._)|üîó|

## üîà **Pronunciation Essentials**

|üó£Ô∏è Rule|Example|Note|
|---|---|---|
|**Subordinating conjunctions link clauses**|_–û–Ω –ø–æ—à—ë–ª, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–Ω._ (_He went because he was hungry._)|These conjunctions show the reason or cause behind the main action.|
|**Relative clauses give more detail about a noun**|_–ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å–∏–¥–∏—Ç —Ä—è–¥–æ–º, –º–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥._ (_The person who is sitting next to me is my friend._)|Relative clauses give extra information about nouns in the sentence.|
|**Complex sentences involve both main and embedded clauses**|_–Ø —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –±—É–¥—É –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–æ._ (_I said that I will be late._)|Understanding the relationship between the clauses is key in forming correct Russian sentences.|
