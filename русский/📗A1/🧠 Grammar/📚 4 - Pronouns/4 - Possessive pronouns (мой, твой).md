| üá∑üá∫ Topic | 9 - Possessive Pronouns (–º–æ–π, —Ç–≤–æ–π) |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |

### üìö Introduction

Possessive pronouns in Russian are used to express ownership or possession. They correspond to the English possessive forms like "my", "your", "his", "her", etc. These pronouns **agree in gender, number, and case** with the noun they modify, much like adjectives.

The most common possessive pronouns are **–º–æ–π (my)**, **—Ç–≤–æ–π (your)**, **–µ–≥–æ (his)**, **–µ—ë (her)**, **–Ω–∞—à (our)**, **–≤–∞—à (your - plural or formal)**, **–∏—Ö (their)**.

|English|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|my|–º–æ–π|–º–æ—è|–º–æ—ë|–º–æ–∏|
|your (informal)|—Ç–≤–æ–π|—Ç–≤–æ—è|—Ç–≤–æ—ë|—Ç–≤–æ–∏|
|his|–µ–≥–æ|–µ–≥–æ|–µ–≥–æ|–µ–≥–æ|
|her|–µ—ë|–µ—ë|–µ—ë|–µ—ë|
|our|–Ω–∞—à|–Ω–∞—à–∞|–Ω–∞—à–µ|–Ω–∞—à–∏|
|your (plural/formal)|–≤–∞—à|–≤–∞—à–∞|–≤–∞—à–µ|–≤–∞—à–∏|
|their|–∏—Ö|–∏—Ö|–∏—Ö|–∏—Ö|

üìå These forms are used when the noun is the **subject** of the sentence (Nominative case).

### üß† 3 - Declension of Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns decline just like adjectives based on **gender**, **number**, and **case**. Here's an example with **–º–æ–π** (my):

#### Masculine - ‚Äú–º–æ–π‚Äù (my)

|Case|Form|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Nominative|–º–æ–π|–º–æ–π –±—Ä–∞—Ç (my brother)|
|Accusative|–º–æ–µ–≥–æ*|–Ø –≤–∏–∂—É –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –±—Ä–∞—Ç–∞.|
|Genitive|–º–æ–µ–≥–æ|–£ –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –±—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞.|
|Dative|–º–æ–µ–º—É|–Ø –¥–∞–ª –º–æ–µ–º—É –±—Ä–∞—Ç—É –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.|
|Instrumental|–º–æ–∏–º|–° –º–æ–∏–º –±—Ä–∞—Ç–æ–º –≤–µ—Å–µ–ª–æ.|
|Prepositional|–º–æ—ë–º|–û –º–æ—ë–º –±—Ä–∞—Ç–µ —è –∑–Ω–∞—é.|

* Masculine animate nouns take Genitive in the Accusative case.

### üîó 4 - Possession Without a Noun (When "my" or "your" stands alone)

In some situations, the possessive pronoun can stand alone without a noun. In such cases, it's usually clear from context what is being possessed.

|Russian Sentence|English Translation|
|---|---|
|–≠—Ç–æ **–º–æ–π**.|This is **mine**.|
|–≠—Ç–æ **—Ç–≤–æ–π**.|This is **yours**.|

---

### üéØ Conclusion

Possessive pronouns like **–º–æ–π**, **—Ç–≤–æ–π**, **–Ω–∞—à**, and others are vital to expressing ownership in Russian. They **change according to the noun's gender, case, and number**, so mastering them is essential for fluency. Use them confidently to show possession in both simple and complex sentences.
