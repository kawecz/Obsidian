### üß† 6 - Notes

- **Pronunciation alert**:
    
    - "–µ—ë" (her) sounds like _ye-yo_, not _eyo_
        
    - "–µ–≥–æ" and "–∏—Ö" are pronounced _ye-vo_ and _eekh_ (not as written)
        
- Some pronouns have **alternative stressed forms** for emphasis or style, e.g., **–º–Ω–æ–π / –º–Ω–æ—é**, **–µ—é / –µ–π**
