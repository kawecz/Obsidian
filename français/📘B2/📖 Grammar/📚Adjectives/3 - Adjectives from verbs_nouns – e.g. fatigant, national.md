- **-ible / -able** suffixes often mean "capable of being..." (_visible_ = able to be seen, _aimable_ = able to be liked).
    
- **-al, -ique, -el** suffixes usually form adjectives meaning "related to" or "characteristic of" the noun.
    
- Some derived adjectives agree in gender and number like normal adjectives (_fatigante_, _nationales_).
