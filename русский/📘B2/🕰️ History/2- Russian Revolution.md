### üìö Introduction

The Russian Revolution refers to a series of political and social upheavals in Russia in the early 20th century that led to the fall of the Romanov monarchy and the rise of the Soviet Union. It is divided into two major phases: the **February Revolution** and the **October Revolution** of 1917. These events not only reshaped Russian society but also had a profound impact on world history, leading to the spread of communism and altering global political dynamics.
