### üìö Introduction

Subordinate clauses in Russian help express **conditions**, **reasons**, and **purposes**, similar to English structures like "if", "because", and "in order to." These clauses are introduced by **subordinating conjunctions** and are an essential part of constructing more complex, natural sentences. In this lesson, we focus on three common conjunctions: **–µ—Å–ª–∏ (if)**, **–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ (because)**, and **—á—Ç–æ–±—ã (in order to/so that)**.

### üîó 1 - –ï—Å–ª–∏ (If) ‚Äî Conditional Clauses

**–ï—Å–ª–∏** introduces a condition for something to happen, similar to "if" in English.

|Russian|English|
|---|---|
|–ï—Å–ª–∏ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –¥–æ–∂–¥—å, –º—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ–º—Å—è –¥–æ–º–∞.|If it rains, we will stay home.|
|–ï—Å–ª–∏ —è —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–µ–Ω, —è –ø–æ–º–æ–≥—É —Ç–µ–±–µ.|If I am free, I‚Äôll help you.|

Structure:

- **Main Clause** + **–µ—Å–ª–∏** + **Subordinate Clause**

### üîç 2 - –ü–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ (Because) ‚Äî Causal Clauses

**–ü–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ** gives a reason for the main action. It corresponds to "because."

|Russian|English|
|---|---|
|–Ø –¥–æ–º–∞, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ —è –±–æ–ª–µ–Ω.|I‚Äôm at home because I‚Äôm sick.|
|–ú—ã –Ω–µ –ø–æ—à–ª–∏, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ —à—ë–ª –¥–æ–∂–¥—å.|We didn‚Äôt go because it was raining.|

Structure:

- **Main Clause** + **–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ** + **Reason**

### üéØ 3 - –ß—Ç–æ–±—ã (In Order To / So That) ‚Äî Purpose Clauses

**–ß—Ç–æ–±—ã** expresses a purpose or goal, like "in order to" or "so that."

|Russian|English|
|---|---|
|–Ø —É—á—É —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å —Å –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º–∏.|I study Russian in order to talk with friends.|
|–û–Ω —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å –¥–µ–Ω—å–≥–∏.|He works to earn money.|

Structure:

- **Main Clause** + **—á—Ç–æ–±—ã** + **Verb in infinitive or past tense (depending on subject)**
    

**Note:** When the subject is the same in both clauses, use **infinitive** after **—á—Ç–æ–±—ã**.  
If the subjects differ, the verb will be conjugated (often in the past).

### üéØ Conclusion

Mastering subordinate clauses with **–µ—Å–ª–∏**, **–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ**, and **—á—Ç–æ–±—ã** allows you to construct more expressive and logical sentences in Russian. These conjunctions clarify **conditions**, **causes**, and **purposes**, helping you connect ideas naturally and meaningfully in conversation and writing.
