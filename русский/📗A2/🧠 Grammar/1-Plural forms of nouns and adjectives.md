### üîë 1 - Plural Nouns (–ú–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö)

To form the plural of Russian nouns, different rules apply depending on the gender and ending of the word.

#### 1.1 - Masculine Nouns (–ú—É–∂—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–æ–¥)

- For most masculine nouns ending in a consonant, add **-—ã** or **-–∏**:
    
    - —Å—Ç–æ–ª (table) ‚Üí —Å—Ç–æ–ª—ã (tables)
        
    - –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥ (city) ‚Üí –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ (cities)
        
- Masculine nouns ending in **-–π** or **-—å** change to **-–∏**:
    
    - –º—É–∑–µ–π (museum) ‚Üí –º—É–∑–µ–∏ (museums)
        
    - –≥–µ—Ä–æ–π (hero) ‚Üí –≥–µ—Ä–æ–∏ (heroes)
        

#### 1.2 - Feminine Nouns (–ñ–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–æ–¥)

- Feminine nouns ending in **-–∞** or **-—è** change to **-—ã** or **-–∏**:
    
    - –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ (book) ‚Üí –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ (books)
        
    - –ª–æ—à–∞–¥—å (horse) ‚Üí –ª–æ—à–∞–¥–∏ (horses)
        
- Feminine nouns ending in **-—å** change to **-–∏**:
    
    - –Ω–æ—á—å (night) ‚Üí –Ω–æ—á–∏ (nights)
        
    - –¥–æ—á—å (daughter) ‚Üí –¥–æ—á–µ—Ä–∏ (daughters)
        

#### 1.3 - Neuter Nouns (–°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π —Ä–æ–¥)

- Neuter nouns ending in **-–æ** or **-–µ** change to **-–∞** or **-—è**:
    
    - –æ–∫–Ω–æ (window) ‚Üí –æ–∫–Ω–∞ (windows)
        
    - –º–æ—Ä–µ (sea) ‚Üí –º–æ—Ä—è (seas)

### üß™ 2 - Plural Adjectives (–ú–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–∞–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö)

Adjectives in the plural form agree with the noun in both gender and case. The plural form of adjectives typically ends in **-—ã–µ** or **-–∏–µ**.

#### 2.1 - Adjectives for Masculine and Neuter Nouns

- For most adjectives, **-—ã–π** or **-–∏–π** changes to **-—ã–µ** or **-–∏–µ**:
    
    - –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π (beautiful) ‚Üí –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–µ (beautiful, plural)
        
    - –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π (new) ‚Üí –Ω–æ–≤—ã–µ (new, plural)
        

#### 2.2 - Adjectives for Feminine Nouns

- Adjectives ending in **-–∞—è** or **-—è—è** change to **-—ã–µ** or **-–∏–µ** in the plural form:
    
    - –±–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è (big) ‚Üí –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ (big, plural)
        
    - –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è (red) ‚Üí –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã–µ (red, plural)
        

#### 2.3 - Irregular Plural Forms

- Some adjectives, especially those ending in **-–æ–π** or **-–Ω–∏–π**, may undergo more complex changes:
    
    - —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–π (old) ‚Üí —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–µ (old, plural)
        
    - –∑–µ–ª—ë–Ω—ã–π (green) ‚Üí –∑–µ–ª—ë–Ω—ã–µ (green, plural)

Some nouns and adjectives in Russian have irregular plural forms or exceptions to the general rules.

#### 3.1 - Irregular Nouns

- Some masculine nouns ending in **-—å** change to **-–∏** in the plural:

### üéØ Conclusion

The pluralization of nouns and adjectives in Russian is governed by several rules depending on gender, declension, and the ending of the word.
