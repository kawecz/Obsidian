**Explanation:**

In French, the **position of adjectives** (before or after the noun) can **change the meaning** of a phrase from **literal** to **figurative** or vice versa. Many adjectives have two different senses depending on where they appear. This subtlety enriches expression but can be tricky for learners.

#### 🧱 Basic Rule:

|Adjective Position|Meaning Type|
|---|---|
|**Before the noun**|Often figurative, subjective, or emotional meaning|
|**After the noun**|Usually literal, descriptive, or neutral meaning|

#### 📊 Common Examples:

|Example|Before the Noun (Figurative)|After the Noun (Literal)|English Meaning Difference|
|---|---|---|---|
|**un grand homme**|A great man (important, respected)|un homme grand = a tall man|_Great_ (figurative) vs. _tall_ (literal)|
|**un pauvre garçon**|A poor boy (unfortunate, pitiable)|un garçon pauvre = a boy without money|_Unfortunate_ vs. _financially poor_|
|**un ancien professeur**|A former teacher (ex-)|un professeur ancien = an old teacher|_Former_ vs. _aged_|
|**un certain problème**|A certain/some problem (vague, particular)|un problème certain = a definite problem|_Some/particular_ vs. _definite_|
|**une chère amie**|A dear/valued friend|une amie chère = an expensive friend|_Dear_ (emotional) vs. _expensive_|
|**un simple geste**|A mere/simple gesture (insignificant)|un geste simple = a simple/ordinary gesture|_Mere_ (downplaying) vs. _simple_ (plain)|

#### 📝 Notes on Usage:

- Adjectives that typically go **before** the noun and change meaning include:  
    _grand, pauvre, ancien, certain, cher, simple, même, prochain_
    
- When adjectives are placed **after** the noun, they describe **physical qualities or factual descriptions**.
    
- The **figurative meaning** often conveys feelings, judgments, or subjective qualities, while the **literal meaning** states a fact.
