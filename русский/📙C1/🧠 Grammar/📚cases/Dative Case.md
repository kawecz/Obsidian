## üéØ Introduction

The **Dative case** (_–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂_) in Russian is used to indicate the **indirect object** of an action ‚Äî to whom or for whom something is done. It also expresses **age**, **necessity**, and certain feelings or states. The main question it answers is: _‚Äúto whom?‚Äù_ or _‚Äúfor whom?‚Äù_

## üìò Formation of the Dative Case

- For **masculine and neuter nouns** ending in a consonant or **-–æ**, add **-—É** or **-—é**:  
    _—Å—Ç–æ–ª ‚Üí —Å—Ç–æ–ª—É_ (to the table), _–æ–∫–Ω–æ ‚Üí –æ–∫–Ω—É_ (to the window)
    
- For **feminine nouns** ending in **-–∞ / -—è**, replace with **-–µ** or **-–∏**:  
    _–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ ‚Üí –∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ_ (to the book), _–Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—è ‚Üí –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ_ (to the week)
    
- For **feminine nouns** ending in **-—å**, add **-–∏**:  
    _–¥–≤–µ—Ä—å ‚Üí –¥–≤–µ—Ä–∏_ (to the door)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The dative case is used after certain verbs like _–ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∞—Ç—å_ (to help), _–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å_ (to give), and expressions of feelings.
    
- Personal pronouns have special dative forms: _–º–Ω–µ_ (to me), _—Ç–µ–±–µ_ (to you), _–µ–º—É_ (to him), _–µ–π_ (to her), _–Ω–∞–º_ (to us), _–≤–∞–º_ (to you plural/formal), _–∏–º_ (to them).
    

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Dative case is essential for showing **to whom or for whom** actions are done, expressing age, necessity, and feelings. Mastery of its endings and usage helps in communicating clearly about indirect objects and personal states in Russian.
