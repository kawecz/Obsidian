### üìö Introduction

Modal verbs in Russian express **ability, necessity, permission, desire, and intention**, just like in English (can, must, should, etc.). Unlike other verbs, **modal verbs often pair with infinitives** and influence the meaning of the action rather than express it directly. This lesson explores how modal verbs work across different tenses and how they interact with verb aspects.

### üß™ 3 - Modal Verbs in the Past Tense

Most modal verbs conjugate in the past tense like other verbs or appear in fixed constructions.

|Verb|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–º–æ—á—å|–Ø **–º–æ–≥** –ø—Ä–∏–π—Ç–∏.|I could come.|
|—Ö–æ—Ç–µ—Ç—å|–û–Ω–∞ **—Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª–∞** –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞—Ç—å.|She wanted to rest.|

### üîÆ 4 - Modal Verbs in the Future Tense

Some modal verbs can appear in future tense, though often the future is expressed by combining modals with **future forms** of action verbs.

|Verb|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–º–æ—á—å|–Ø **—Å–º–æ–≥—É** –ø–æ–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å.|I will be able to go.|
|—Ö–æ—Ç–µ—Ç—å|–û–Ω–∏ **–∑–∞—Ö–æ—Ç—è—Ç** –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å—Å—è.|They will want to stay.|
|–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω|–Ø **–±—É–¥—É –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω** –ø—Ä–∏–π—Ç–∏.|I will have to come.|

Note: **–Ω–∞–¥–æ/–Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ** do not have future forms; use future action verb + present modal.

### üß© 5 - Verb Aspect with Modal Verbs

Modal verbs work with both **perfective** and **imperfective** infinitives, depending on whether the action is ongoing or completed.

|Aspect|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Imperfective|–Ø —Ö–æ—á—É **—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å** –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.|I want to read (process).|
|Perfective|–Ø —Ö–æ—á—É **–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å** –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.|I want to read (to finish it).|
|Imperfective|–Ø –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω **–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å** —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É.|I must do the work (ongoing).|
|Perfective|–Ø –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω **—Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å** —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É.|I must finish the work.|
