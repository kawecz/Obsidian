### üìö Introduction

Subordinating conjunctions are words used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause. They show the relationship between the two parts of the sentence, indicating reasons, conditions, time, and cause. In Russian, subordinating conjunctions help form more complex and nuanced sentences.
