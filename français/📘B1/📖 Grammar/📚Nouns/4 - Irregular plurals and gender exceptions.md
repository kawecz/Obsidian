**Explanation:**

In French, most nouns follow regular patterns for **plural formation** and **gender assignment**, but many common words are **exceptions**. These irregularities are essential to learn because they occur frequently in everyday language and can affect agreement with adjectives and verbs.

#### ðŸ“Œ Part 1: **Irregular Plurals**

Most French nouns form the plural by adding **-s**, but some change spelling or form completely differently.

|Singular|Plural|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**un animal**|**des animaux**|-al â†’ -aux (common pattern)|
|**un cheval**|**des chevaux**|-al â†’ -aux|
|**un journal**|**des journaux**|-al â†’ -aux|
|**un travail**|**des travaux**|Irregular plural|
|**un Å“il**|**des yeux**|Completely irregular|
|**monsieur**|**messieurs**|Formal and irregular|
|**madame**|**mesdames**|Formal plural|
|**mademoiselle**|**mesdemoiselles**|Formal plural|

âœ… Most words ending in **-s, -x, or -z** in the singular **donâ€™t change in the plural**:

- _un choix â†’ des choix_
    
- _un nez â†’ des nez_

#### ðŸ“Œ Part 2: **Gender Exceptions**

French nouns are either **masculine** or **feminine**, but not all follow logical patterns. Some words ending in **-e** are masculine, and some typical masculine endings can be feminine.

|Noun|Gender|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**le problÃ¨me**|Masculine|Ends in _-Ã¨me_, often masculine|
|**le systÃ¨me**|Masculine|Exception to -e rule|
|**le programme**|Masculine|From Greek origin, masculine|
|**la mer**|Feminine|Simple exception|
|**la voiture**|Feminine|Ends in -ure, usually feminine|
|**le silence**|Masculine|Ends in -ence, which is usually feminine|
|**la main**|Feminine|Irregular and very common exception|
|**le lycÃ©e**|Masculine|Ends in -Ã©e but still masculine|
|**la photo**|Feminine|Short for _photographie_ (influences gender)|

ðŸ§  Some nouns **change gender** depending on their meaning:

- _un livre_ (a book) â†’ _une livre_ (a pound â€“ weight or currency)
    
- _un tour_ (a trip) â†’ _une tour_ (a tower)
    

---

#### ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters:

- Adjectives and past participles must **agree** in gender and number.
    
- Using the **wrong plural or gender** changes the meaning or causes confusion.
    
- These exceptions appear in **daily conversation and formal writing**.

**Summary:**  
French has many **irregular plurals** like _animaux_, _yeux_, and _travaux_, and **gender exceptions** such as _le problÃ¨me_ and _la main_. Recognizing these patterns helps you write and speak **accurately and fluently**, especially when matching adjectives and articles. Consistent practice with these high-frequency exceptions will solidify your grasp of French grammar. ðŸ§ ðŸ“–
