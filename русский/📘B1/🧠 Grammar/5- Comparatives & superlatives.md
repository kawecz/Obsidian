### üìö Introduction

In Russian, adjectives change their forms to express **comparison** between two or more things (comparatives) or to show that something or someone has the **highest degree** of a quality (superlatives). Just like in English, Russian uses different forms and constructions to build comparatives and superlatives. Some follow regular rules, while others are irregular and must be memorized.

### ü™û 1 - Comparatives (–°—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω—å)

There are **two main ways** to form comparatives in Russian:

#### A) **Simple Comparative Form** (One-word form)

Most adjectives can form comparatives by:

- Removing the adjective ending **-—ã–π/-–∏–π/-–æ–π**
    
- Adding **-–µ–µ** or **-–µ–π** (based on phonetic rules)
    

|Positive|Comparative|English|
|---|---|---|
|–±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä—ã–π (fast)|–±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–µ|faster|
|—Å–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π (strong)|—Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–µ–µ|stronger|
|—É–º–Ω—ã–π (smart)|—É–º–Ω–µ–µ|smarter|
|—Ç–∏—Ö–∏–π (quiet)|—Ç–∏—à–µ (irregular)|quieter|
|—Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π (good)|–ª—É—á—à–µ (irregular)|better|
|–ø–ª–æ—Ö–æ–π (bad)|—Ö—É–∂–µ (irregular)|worse|

**Examples:**

- **–ú–æ–π –±—Ä–∞—Ç –≤—ã—à–µ –º–µ–Ω—è.** ‚Äî My brother is taller than me.
    
- **–≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–µ–µ.** ‚Äî This movie is more interesting.
    
- **–°–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–µ–µ, —á–µ–º –≤—á–µ—Ä–∞.** ‚Äî Today is colder than yesterday.
    

#### B) **Analytic Comparative Form** (Using "–±–æ–ª–µ–µ")

Used with:

- Long adjectives
    
- Adjectives that don't form simple comparatives
    

**Structure:**  
**–±–æ–ª–µ–µ + adjective in base form**

|Positive|Comparative|English|
|---|---|---|
|–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π|–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π|more beautiful|
|—É–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–π|–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —É–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–π|more comfortable|
|–∞–∫–∫—É—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π|–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∞–∫–∫—É—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π|more neat|

**Examples:**

- **–≠—Ç–∞ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–ª–∞—è.** ‚Äî This room is brighter.
    
- **–û–Ω –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –≤–µ–∂–ª–∏–≤—ã–π, —á–µ–º —Ç—ã.** ‚Äî He is more polite than you.

### üèÜ 2 - Superlatives (–ü—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω—å)

There are also **two main ways** to form superlatives in Russian:

#### A) **Using ‚Äú—Å–∞–º—ã–π‚Äù + adjective**

This is the most common and regular way.

**Structure:**  
**—Å–∞–º—ã–π + adjective**

|Base Adjective|Superlative|English|
|---|---|---|
|–±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä—ã–π|—Å–∞–º—ã–π –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä—ã–π|the fastest|
|–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π|—Å–∞–º–∞—è –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–∞—è|the most beautiful (feminine)|
|—Å–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π|—Å–∞–º—ã–π —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π|the strongest|

**Examples:**

- **–û–Ω —Å–∞–º—ã–π –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏–π –≤ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–µ.** ‚Äî He is the tallest in the class.
    
- **–≠—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º–∞—è –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞.** ‚Äî This is the most interesting book.
    

#### B) **Using suffixes -–µ–π—à- / -–∞–π—à- (Literary/Stylistic)**

These are less common and mostly found in formal or literary Russian.

|Base|Superlative|English|
|---|---|---|
|—É–º–Ω—ã–π|—É–º–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–π|the wisest|
|–±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—ã–π|–±–æ–≥–∞—Ç–µ–π—à–∏–π|the richest|
|–±–µ–¥–Ω—ã–π|–±–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–π|the poorest|

**Examples:**

- **–û–Ω —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ –≤–µ–ª–∏—á–∞–π—à–∏–π.** ‚Äî He is a most great person.
    
- **–≠—Ç–æ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–µ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ.** ‚Äî This is the most important discovery.

### üéØ Conclusion

To express comparison or superiority in Russian, use comparatives for "more/less" and superlatives for "most/least." You can choose between simple forms and analytic forms depending on the adjective. Irregular forms must be memorized, and superlatives can be made using **—Å–∞–º—ã–π** or stylistic suffixes. Mastery of these structures adds richness and precision to your Russian.
