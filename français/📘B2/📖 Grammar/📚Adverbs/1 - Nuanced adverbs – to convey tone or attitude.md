**Explanation:**

In French, **nuanced adverbs** are used to add subtle shades of meaning to a sentence, especially to express the speaker’s **tone, attitude, or feelings**. These adverbs go beyond simple descriptions of time, place, or manner; they influence how the message is perceived — whether it’s ironic, hesitant, certain, or emotional.

#### 📝 Placement and Usage:

- These adverbs generally appear **before the main verb** or **between auxiliary and main verb** in compound tenses:  
    _Il **vraiment** aime ça._ → _Il **a vraiment** aimé ça._
    
- They often modify the whole sentence or the speaker’s perspective, not just a single action.
    
- They can **soften** statements (_peut-être_), **strengthen** assertions (_vraiment_), or **express emotion** (_heureusement_, _malheureusement_).
