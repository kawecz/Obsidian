## üìö Introduction

The **Genitive case** (_—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂_) in Russian expresses **possession, quantity, absence, and relationships between nouns**. It often answers the questions: _‚Äúof whom?‚Äù_, _‚Äúof what?‚Äù_, _‚Äúhow much?‚Äù_, or _‚Äúthere is no‚Ä¶‚Äù_. It is used after certain prepositions and with negation.

## üìò Formation of the Genitive Case

- For **masculine and neuter nouns** ending in a consonant, add **-–∞** or **-—è**:  
    _—Å—Ç–æ–ª ‚Üí —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞_ (of the table), _–¥–æ–º ‚Üí –¥–æ–º–∞_ (of the house)
    
- For **feminine nouns** ending in **-–∞ / -—è**, replace with **-—ã** or **-–∏**:  
    _–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ ‚Üí –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏_ (of the book), _–Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—è ‚Üí –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏_ (of the week)
    
- For **feminine nouns** ending in **-—å**, replace with **-–∏**:  
    _–¥–≤–µ—Ä—å ‚Üí –¥–≤–µ—Ä–∏_ (of the door)

|After some prepositions|_–±–µ–∑ —Å–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–∞_|without sugar|

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- After negation, the direct object usually takes genitive instead of accusative.
    
- After some prepositions like _–±–µ–∑_ (without), _—É_ (at, with), _–¥–ª—è_ (for), genitive is required.
    
- Some nouns have irregular genitive forms, especially plurals.
