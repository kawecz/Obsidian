### üìö Introduction

In Russian, the use of cases plays a crucial role in structuring sentences and conveying meaning. Russian has six grammatical cases, and their use extends to both singular and plural forms. Understanding how to use all six cases in plural and with prepositions is vital for correct sentence construction. The meaning of the case often changes depending on the preposition it accompanies. In this lesson, we‚Äôll explore the plural forms of the cases, their typical prepositions, and provide examples to help you master them.

### üîë 1 - Nominative Case (–ò–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence. In plural, it indicates the "who" or "what" that is performing the action. The nominative case does not require a preposition.

**Example:**

- **–ú—É–∂—á–∏–Ω—ã —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—é—Ç.** ‚Äî The men are working.
    
- **–î–µ—Ç–∏ –∏–≥—Ä–∞—é—Ç.** ‚Äî The children are playing.

### üß™ 2 - Genitive Case (–†–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The genitive case indicates possession, absence, or quantity. In plural, it answers the questions "whose?" or "how many?" Common prepositions with the genitive case include **–±–µ–∑** (without), **—É** (by, at someone's place), **–¥–ª—è** (for), and **–æ—Ç** (from).

**Example:**

- **–£ –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ—Ç –∫–Ω–∏–≥.** ‚Äî We don't have books.
    
- **–Ø –∫—É–ø–∏–ª –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ç.** ‚Äî I bought many candies.
    
- **–ë–µ–∑ –ª—é–¥–µ–π —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –ø–∞—Ä–∫ –ø—É—Å—Ç–æ–π.** ‚Äî This park is empty without people.

### üß† 3 - Dative Case (–î–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The dative case is used to indicate the indirect object, typically answering the question "to whom?" or "for whom?". In plural, it is often used with prepositions such as **–∫** (to), **–ø–æ** (according to, along), and **–¥–ª—è** (for).

**Example:**

- **–Ø –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∞—é –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º.** ‚Äî I help my friends.
    
- **–ú—ã –∏–¥—ë–º –∫ —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º.** ‚Äî We are going to our parents.
    
- **–û–Ω –¥–∞—ë—Ç –ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä–∫–∏ –¥–µ—Ç—è–º.** ‚Äî He gives gifts to the children.

### üîó 4 - Accusative Case (–í–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The accusative case is used for the direct object of the sentence, answering the questions "whom?" or "what?". In plural, it is used with prepositions such as **–≤** (into), **–Ω–∞** (onto), and **–∑–∞** (behind, for).

**Example:**

- **–Ø –≤–∏–∂—É –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π.** ‚Äî I see the children.
    
- **–ú—ã –∏–¥—ë–º –≤ –º–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω—ã.** ‚Äî We are going to the stores.
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ –∏—â–µ—Ç –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏.** ‚Äî She is looking for books.

### üß™ 5 - Instrumental Case (–¢–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The instrumental case is used to indicate the means by which an action is performed, answering the question "with what?" or "by whom?". It is commonly used with prepositions like **—Å** (with), **–∑–∞** (behind, for), and **–º–µ–∂–¥—É** (between).

**Example:**

- **–ú—ã –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ–º —Å –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º–∏.** ‚Äî We are playing with friends.
    
- **–û–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç —Å –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–≥–∞–º–∏.** ‚Äî She works with colleagues.
    
- **–û–Ω –µ–¥–µ—Ç –∑–∞ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏.** ‚Äî He is going for cars.

### üß† 6 - Prepositional Case (–ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂)

The prepositional case is used to indicate location or about something, answering the questions "about whom?" or "about what?". It is used with prepositions such as **–æ** (about), **–≤** (in), **–Ω–∞** (on), and **–æ** (about).

**Example:**

- **–ú—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º –æ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞—Ö.** ‚Äî We are talking about books.
    
- **–î–µ—Ç–∏ –≤ –ø–∞—Ä–∫–µ.** ‚Äî The children are in the park.
    
- **–ú—ã —Å–∏–¥–∏–º –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—É–ª—å—è—Ö.** ‚Äî We are sitting on the chairs.

### üéØ Conclusion

Mastering the use of the six cases in plural is essential for constructing accurate and meaningful sentences in Russian. Understanding how each case functions and which prepositions are typically used with them will help you communicate more effectively. As you practice these cases with different prepositions, you‚Äôll become more comfortable with Russian grammar and improve your fluency.
