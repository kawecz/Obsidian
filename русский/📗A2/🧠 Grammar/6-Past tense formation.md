### üìö Introduction

The past tense in Russian is used to describe actions or events that have already happened. Unlike English, the past tense in Russian does not require an auxiliary verb ("have," "did") but is formed by changing the verb according to gender and number. Understanding how to form and use the past tense is crucial for narrating past events and sharing experiences.

### üîë 1 - General Rules for Past Tense Formation

To form the past tense of regular verbs in Russian, follow these steps:

- Remove the infinitive ending (-—Ç—å, -—Ç–∏, etc.) from the verb.
    
- Add the past tense ending, depending on the gender and number of the subject.
    

**For Masculine**:

- The verb typically ends with **-–ª**.
    

**For Feminine**:

- The verb typically ends with **-–ª–∞**.
    

**For Neuter**:

- The verb typically ends with **-–ª–æ**.
    

**For Plural**:

- The verb typically ends with **-–ª–∏**.

### üß™ 4 - Aspect and the Past Tense

In Russian, the past tense is closely connected to aspect, which refers to whether the action is completed or ongoing. The past tense forms are often used to distinguish between perfective and imperfective aspects.

- **Imperfective aspect**: Describes ongoing or habitual actions in the past.
    
    - **–Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî I was reading a book.
        
- **Perfective aspect**: Describes completed actions in the past.
    
    - **–Ø –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É.** ‚Äî I read the book (and finished it).
