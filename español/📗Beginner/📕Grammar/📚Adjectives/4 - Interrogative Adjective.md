🌟 **Interrogative Adjectives in Spanish** 🌟  
📚 **Topic 4: _Qué, Cuánto, Cuánta, Cuántos, Cuántas_**
📘 **Introduction**

An **interrogative adjective** is a question word that modifies a noun and helps form **direct or indirect questions**. In Spanish, the most common interrogative adjectives are **_qué_ (what/which)** and **_cuánto/a/os/as_ (how much/many)**. They are always written with a **written accent (tilde)** and must agree in **gender** and **number** with the noun they accompany. These words are essential for gathering information and having interactive, curious conversations in Spanish. ❓🗣️

🧠 **How to Identify Them**

- They are placed **before** a **noun** they are modifying.
    
- They **always appear in questions**, either **direct** or **indirect**.
    
- They are **not** the same as interrogative pronouns, which replace a noun rather than modify it.
    

📝 **Direct vs. Indirect Question:**

|📘 Sentence Type|🧾 Spanish Sentence|💬 English Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Direct Question|¿**Qué** comida prefieres?|What food do you prefer?|
|Indirect Question|No sé **qué** comida prefieres.|I don’t know what food you prefer.|

🚫 **Common Mistake to Avoid**

- Don't confuse **qué** (what) as an adjective with **cuál** (which), which functions more as a **pronoun** when followed by a verb or preposition.
    
    - ✅ ¿Qué libro quieres? → What book do you want? (adjective)
        
    - ✅ ¿Cuál quieres? → Which one do you want? (pronoun)
