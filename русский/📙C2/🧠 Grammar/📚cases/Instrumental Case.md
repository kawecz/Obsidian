## üõ†Ô∏è Introduction

The **Instrumental case** (_—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂_) in Russian is used to indicate **the means or instrument** by which an action is performed, as well as to express **accompaniment**, **profession**, and certain time expressions. It answers the questions: _‚Äúwith whom?‚Äù_ or _‚Äúwith what?‚Äù_

## üìò Formation of the Instrumental Case

- For **masculine and neuter nouns** ending in a consonant or **-–æ**, add **-–æ–º** or **-–µ–º**:  
    _—Å—Ç–æ–ª ‚Üí —Å—Ç–æ–ª–æ–º_ (with the table), _–æ–∫–Ω–æ ‚Üí –æ–∫–Ω–æ–º_ (with the window)
    
- For **feminine nouns** ending in **-–∞ / -—è**, replace with **-–æ–π** or **-–µ–π**:  
    _–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ ‚Üí –∫–Ω–∏–≥–æ–π_ (with the book), _–Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—è ‚Üí –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–π_ (with the week)
    
- For **feminine nouns** ending in **-—å**, add **-—å—é**:  
    _–¥–≤–µ—Ä—å ‚Üí –¥–≤–µ—Ä—å—é_ (with the door)
    
- For **plural nouns** of all genders, add **-–∞–º–∏** or **-—è–º–∏**:  
    _—Å—Ç–æ–ª—ã ‚Üí —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞–º–∏_ (with tables), _–¥–≤–µ—Ä–∏ ‚Üí –¥–≤–µ—Ä—è–º–∏_ (with doors)
