### üìö Introduction

Modal verbs in Russian are used to express necessity, possibility, or desire. Unlike in English, Russian modal verbs do not change based on the subject (they are generally conjugated in their infinitive form), but they are used to modify the meaning of the main verb in a sentence. Common modal verbs include **–º–æ—á—å** (can, be able to), **—Ö–æ—Ç–µ—Ç—å** (want), and **–Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ** (need). These verbs play a key role in daily communication.
