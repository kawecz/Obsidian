## üîó Introduction

**Coordinating conjunctions** (_—Å–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—é–∑—ã_) in Russian are used to **connect words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical value**. They are essential for creating compound sentences and smooth, logical speech. Unlike subordinating conjunctions, they do **not change word order** or affect case usage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Russian does **not use a comma before "–∏"** like English often does before "and" (Oxford comma).
    
- Use commas before **–Ω–æ**, **–∞**, **–∏–ª–∏** when connecting full clauses:
    
    - _–û–Ω –ø—Ä–∏—à—ë–ª, –Ω–æ –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª._
        
    - _–Ø —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª, –∞ –æ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ–º–æ–ª—á–∞–ª._
        

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Russian **coordinating conjunctions** help join equal parts of speech or clauses. The most common are _–∏, –∞, –Ω–æ,_ and _–∏–ª–∏_. Understanding their meanings and usage is key to forming more natural and complex sentences. Practice by combining short statements into longer ones using these connectors.
