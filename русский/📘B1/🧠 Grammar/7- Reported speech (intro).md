|---|---|

### üìö Introduction

**Reported speech** in Russian (–∫–æ—Å–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ä–µ—á—å) is used to convey what someone else has said **without quoting them directly**. This is similar to English:

> Direct: She said, ‚ÄúI am tired.‚Äù  
> Reported: She said **that she was tired.**

In Russian, the transformation involves **changing pronouns, verb tenses**, and sometimes **word order**, but it generally follows a logical structure. This lesson introduces the basics of reported speech and how to use it correctly in everyday communication.

### üó£Ô∏è 1 - Direct vs. Reported Speech

|Type|Russian|English|
|---|---|---|
|Direct|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: ¬´–Ø –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç.¬ª|He said, ‚ÄúI am busy.‚Äù|
|Reported|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç.|He said (that) he was busy.|

---

### üß© 2 - Structure of Reported Speech

The basic formula in Russian is:

**Main Clause** + **—á—Ç–æ** + **Subordinate Clause**

|Part|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Main Clause|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞|She said|
|—á—Ç–æ|—á—Ç–æ|that|
|Subordinate Clause|–æ–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—Ç –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞|she would come tomorrow|

**Example:**  
**–û–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—Ç –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞.** ‚Äî She said that she would come tomorrow.

### üîÑ 3 - Pronoun Changes

When converting direct to reported speech, you must adjust **pronouns** to fit the new speaker.

|Direct|Reported|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–Ø (I)|–æ–Ω/–æ–Ω–∞ (he/she)|–Ø –¥–æ–º–∞ ‚Üí –û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ **–æ–Ω** –¥–æ–º–∞.|
|—Ç—ã (you)|—è/–æ–Ω/–æ–Ω–∞ (I/he/she)|–¢—ã –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—à—å? ‚Üí –û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª, **–ø—Ä–∏–¥—É** –ª–∏ —è.|

### ‚è±Ô∏è 4 - Verb Tense in Reported Speech

Russian **does not always change the tense** as English does. Instead, **verbs often remain in the same tense**, especially with verbs of saying like "—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å" or "–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å".

|Direct|Reported|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–Ø —É—á—É—Å—å.|–û–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∞ —É—á–∏—Ç—Å—è.|I study. ‚Üí She said that she studies.|
|–Ø –±—ã–ª —Ç–∞–º.|–û–Ω —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –±—ã–ª —Ç–∞–º.|I was there. ‚Üí He said that he was there.|

### ‚ùì 5 - Reporting Questions

To report **yes/no** or **wh-questions**, Russian uses:

- **–ª–∏** for yes/no questions
    
- Question words (–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞, –≥–¥–µ, –ø–æ—á–µ–º—É, etc.) for wh-questions
    

|Direct Question|Reported Speech|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|–¢—ã –¥–æ–º–∞?|–û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª, –¥–æ–º–∞ –ª–∏ —Ç—ã.|He asked if you were home.|
|–ì–¥–µ –æ–Ω–∞?|–û–Ω —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª, –≥–¥–µ –æ–Ω–∞.|He asked where she was.|

---

### üéØ Conclusion

Reported speech in Russian is used to tell what someone else said without quoting them word-for-word. It often requires adjusting **pronouns**, using **—á—Ç–æ** to introduce the subordinate clause, and sometimes reordering **verbs** or inserting **–ª–∏** for questions. While tense shifts are less dramatic than in English, mastering these elements is key to fluent and accurate communication.
