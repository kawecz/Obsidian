# üó£Ô∏è Russian Final Devoicing (–û–≥–ª—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ)

## üßæ Introduction

In Russian, **voiced consonants** become **voiceless** when:

- They appear at the **end of a word**, or
    
- They come **right before a voiceless consonant**.
    

This rule affects only **paired consonants** (those that have a voiceless partner).  
It does _not_ affect sonorants (–º, –Ω, –ª, —Ä, –π) because they don‚Äôt have voiceless pairs.

## üß© Voiced & voiceless consonant pairs

|Voiced consonant|Voiceless pair|
|---|---|
|–ë (b)|–ü (p)|
|–í (v)|–§ (f)|
|–ì (g)|–ö (k)|
|–î (d)|–¢ (t)|
|–ñ (zh)|–® (sh)|
|–ó (z)|–° (s)|

When any of these voiced consonants appear at the **end of a word**, you pronounce them as their voiceless pair.

## üìå Detailed rule

### 1. At the end of a word

|Written|Pronounced as|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|–¥—É–± (oak)|[dup]|–ë ‚Üí –ü|
|–ª—É–≥ (meadow)|[luk]|–ì ‚Üí –ö|
|–ø—Ä—É–¥ (pond)|[prut]|–î ‚Üí –¢|
|–º–æ—Ä–æ–∑ (frost)|[maros]|–ó ‚Üí –°|
|–Ω–æ–∂ (knife)|[nosh]|–ñ ‚Üí –®|
|–∫—Ä–æ–≤ (roof)|[krof]|–í ‚Üí –§|

### 2. Before a voiceless consonant

The same devoicing happens when the voiced consonant is before a voiceless consonant.

|Written|Pronounced as|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|–ø—Ä–æ—Å—å**–±**–∞ (request)|[proz ≤'ba]|stays –ë because next is voiced –±|
|—Å–∫–∞–∑**–∫**–∞ (fairy tale)|[skatÕ°sk…ô]|–ó before –ö ‚Üí –ó ‚Üí –°, sounds like [skatÕ°sk…ô]|
|–≤–æ–¥–∫–∞ (vodka)|[votka]|–î before –ö ‚Üí –î ‚Üí –¢|

### 3. But: it stays voiced before vowels

If the next sound is a vowel or voiced consonant, it keeps its voiced quality.

|Written|Pronounced as|
|---|---|
|–¥—Ä—É–≥ + –∞ ‚Üí –¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ (friend, genitive)|[druga]|
|–¥—É–± + —ã ‚Üí –¥—É–±—ã (oaks)|[duby]|

---

## ‚ùó Which consonants are NOT affected

- Sonorants: –ú, –ù, –õ, –†, –ô.
    
- Voiceless consonants (–ü, –§, –ö, –¢, –®, –°) stay as they are.

## üìù Summary Table

|Letter|At end of word|Before voiceless|Before vowel|
|---|---|---|---|
|–ë|–ü|–ü|–ë|
|–í|–§|–§|–í|
|–ì|–ö|–ö|–ì|
|–î|–¢|–¢|–î|
|–ñ|–®|–®|–ñ|
|–ó|–°|–°|–ó|

## üéß Tips for practice

- Listen carefully to native speech.
    
- Read words slowly and practice ending them with the correct devoiced sound.
    
- Use minimal pairs to feel the difference: –¥—É–±‚Äì–¥—É–ø, –ª—É–≥‚Äì–ª—É–∫.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Final devoicing is a **phonetic rule**: it doesn‚Äôt change the spelling, only the **pronunciation**.  
Learning it makes your Russian sound more **natural and native-like**, and helps you better understand spoken Russian.
