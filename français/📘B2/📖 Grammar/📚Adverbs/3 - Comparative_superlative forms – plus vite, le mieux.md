- For adjectives, agree in gender and number with the noun after _plus_, _moins_, _aussi_.
    
- For adverbs, the form stays invariable (_plus vite_, _mieux_).
    
- Use **que** for comparisons between two things; use **le/la/les** + superlative + **de** for the “most/least” among a group.
    
- Irregular forms like _mieux_/_le mieux_ replace _plus bien_/_le plus bien_.
