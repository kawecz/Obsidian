## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introduction

The **Nominative case** (_–∏–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂_) is the first and most basic grammatical case in Russian. It answers the questions **"–ö—Ç–æ?" (Who?)** and **"–ß—Ç–æ?" (What?)** and is used primarily to indicate the **subject** of a sentence. It is also the form you will find in dictionaries.

## üìò Function of the Nominative Case

|Usage|Example in Russian|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Subject of the sentence|_–ú–∞–º–∞ –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏—Ç._|Mom is cooking.|
|Predicate noun (identity)|_–û–Ω —É—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å._|He is a teacher.|
|Naming things|_–≠—Ç–æ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞._|This is a book.|

- Don‚Äôt confuse with the **Accusative** case, which can look similar but changes for animate masculine nouns.
    
- Remember adjective-noun agreement: _–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π —Å—Ç–æ–ª_, _–Ω–æ–≤–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞_, _—Å–∏–Ω–µ–µ –º–æ—Ä–µ_.
    

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The **Nominative case** is the starting point in Russian grammar. It names things, states identities, and acts as the subject of a sentence. Learn gender-based endings, recognize singular/plural forms, and practice simple structures to build a solid foundation in Russian grammar.
