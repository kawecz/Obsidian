### üìö Introduction

Russian participles and verbal adverbs are **non-finite verb forms** that function like adjectives and adverbs, respectively. They allow you to express actions in a more compact and descriptive way, often used in writing and formal speech. In this lesson, we introduce two key concepts:

- **Participles (–ø—Ä–∏—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è)** ‚Äî describe nouns (who/what is doing or experiencing something)
    
- **Verbal adverbs (–¥–µ–µ–ø—Ä–∏—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è)** ‚Äî describe how, when, or under what condition an action is performed

### üß© 1 - What Are Participles? (–ü—Ä–∏—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è)

**Participles** are forms of verbs that function like adjectives. They **agree in gender, number, and case** with the noun they describe and can be either **present** or **past**, and **active** or **passive**.

|Type|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Present Active|—á–∏—Ç–∞—é—â–∏–π —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç|the student **who is reading**|
|Past Active|—á–∏—Ç–∞–≤—à–∏–π —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç|the student **who was reading**|
|Present Passive|—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ–º–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞|the book **being read**|
|Past Passive|–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞|the book **that was read**|

These forms help give more detail about **who is doing** or **experiencing** an action.

### üîÑ 2 - What Are Verbal Adverbs? (–î–µ–µ–ø—Ä–∏—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è)

**Verbal adverbs** (also called **gerunds**) describe how or when an action is performed and relate to the subject of the main verb. They are used to express **simultaneous or prior actions**.

|Type|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|
|Imperfective|—á–∏—Ç–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É, –æ–Ω –∑–∞—Å–Ω—É–ª|**While reading** the book, he fell asleep|
|Perfective|–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–≤ –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É, –æ–Ω –∑–∞—Å–Ω—É–ª|**After reading** the book, he fell asleep|

They always refer to the **subject of the main verb**, and they do **not** change form (they are invariable).

### üß† 3 - Usage Tips

- Participles often appear in written or literary Russian.
    
- Verbal adverbs are common in both speech and writing, especially to shorten sentences.
    
- **One subject rule**: verbal adverbs can only be used if the subject of the main clause and the gerund is the same.

### üéØ Conclusion

Participles and verbal adverbs enrich your Russian by letting you describe actions more precisely and compactly. Participles act like adjectives that describe nouns, while verbal adverbs describe the manner or time of an action. Though advanced, mastering these forms allows for more fluid, native-like expression.
