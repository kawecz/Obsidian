🌟 **Immediate Future in Spanish – _Ir a + Infinitive_** 🌟  
📚 **Topic 1️⃣: Talking About What’s Going to Happen**

📘 **Introduction**

In Spanish, the **immediate future tense** is a quick and easy way to talk about what is **going to happen soon**—very much like “I’m going to eat” or “She’s going to travel” in English.

This structure is used constantly in conversation, and it’s essential for expressing your intentions fluently and naturally. 🚀📅🗣️
