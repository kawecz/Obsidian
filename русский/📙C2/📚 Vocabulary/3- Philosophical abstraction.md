## üìö **Introduction**

**Philosophical abstraction** is the process of distilling complex ideas into more fundamental concepts by stripping away specific details and focusing on general principles. In Russian philosophy, this often involves dealing with abstract concepts such as being, consciousness, existence, and truth. Philosophical abstraction is crucial for the development of theoretical thought and enables the exploration of universal questions that transcend specific cultural, historical, or material contexts. Understanding how philosophical abstraction functions in Russian thought can help learners engage deeply with both classical and contemporary philosophical texts.

|**Dialectic (–î–∏–∞–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞)**|A method of argument or reasoning in philosophy where contradictions are seen as a means of progress, often leading to the synthesis of opposing ideas.|_"Thesis vs. antithesis leads to synthesis."_|üîÑ|
|**Abstract Idealism (–ê–±—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∏–¥–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–º)**|A philosophical system that holds that reality is fundamentally mental, with the material world being a manifestation of ideas or consciousness.|_"The world exists as a reflection of the mind."_|üí≠|
|**Phenomenology (–§–µ–Ω–æ–º–µ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è)**|A method of philosophical inquiry that focuses on subjective experience and how objects are perceived by consciousness.|_"We can only know the world as it appears to us, not as it is in itself."_|üëÄ|
