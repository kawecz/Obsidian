**Explanation:**
Noun derivation involves creating **nouns** from other words (like verbs or adjectives) using **prefixes** and **suffixes**. This helps expand vocabulary and express abstract or related ideas more precisely.

**Usage Tips:**

- Not all combinations work; you must learn which suffix fits with which base word.
    
- Some suffixes change spelling depending on the root: _create â†’ creation_ (not _createion_).
    
- Suffixes are more productive in forming nouns than prefixes.

**Summary:**  
Noun derivation helps build vocabulary by adding **suffixes** (like _-tion_, _-ment_, _-ness_) to verbs or adjectives. Prefixes (like _pre-_, _co-_) can also form new nouns but are used less often for this purpose.
