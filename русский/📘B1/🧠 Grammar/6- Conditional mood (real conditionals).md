### üìö Introduction

In Russian, the **conditional mood** (—É—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ) is used to express actions that depend on certain conditions‚Äîjust like in English ‚ÄúIf I had..., I would‚Ä¶‚Äù structures. Real conditionals refer to situations that are possible or likely to happen, usually in the present or future. This lesson will guide you through how to form real conditionals using the correct verb forms and conjunctions.

### üß© 1 - Structure of Real Conditionals

Real conditional sentences in Russian usually follow this pattern:

**–ï—Å–ª–∏ + present/future tense**, **future tense/imperative**

|Part|Russian|English|
|---|---|---|
|Condition|–ï—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–π–¥—ë—Ç –¥–æ–∂–¥—å|If it rains|
|Result|–º—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ–º—Å—è –¥–æ–º–∞|we will stay home|

**Full example:**  
**–ï—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–π–¥—ë—Ç –¥–æ–∂–¥—å, –º—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ–º—Å—è –¥–æ–º–∞.**  
_If it rains, we will stay home._

### üîß 2 - Verb Forms in Real Conditionals

|Clause|Tense Used|Example|Translation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Condition (–µ—Å–ª–∏...)|Present or Future|–ï—Å–ª–∏ –æ–Ω **–ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—Ç**|If he comes|
|Result|Future|—è –µ–º—É **—Å–∫–∞–∂—É**|I will tell him|

**Examples:**

- **–ï—Å–ª–∏ —è —É–≤–∏–∂—É –µ—ë, —è –ø–æ–∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞—é—Å—å.** ‚Äî If I see her, I will say hello.
    
- **–ï—Å–ª–∏ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Ç–µ–ø–ª–æ, –º—ã –ø–æ–π–¥—ë–º –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—É–ª–∫—É.** ‚Äî If it is warm, we will go for a walk.
    
- **–ï—Å–ª–∏ —Ç—ã –≤—ã—É—á–∏—à—å —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞, —Ç—ã —Å–¥–∞—à—å —ç–∫–∑–∞–º–µ–Ω.** ‚Äî If you learn the words, you will pass the exam.

### üóùÔ∏è 3 - Imperative as a Result

Sometimes the result clause uses the **imperative** to express a command or suggestion.

**Example:**

- **–ï—Å–ª–∏ —É–≤–∏–¥–∏—à—å –ê–Ω–Ω—É, —Å–∫–∞–∂–∏ –µ–π –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç.**  
    _If you see Anna, say hi to her._

### üõë 4 - Word Order & Notes

- Russian often **inverts** the order of clauses:  
    **–ú—ã –ø–æ–π–¥—ë–º –Ω–∞ —É–ª–∏—Ü—É, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞.**  
    _We will go outside if the weather is nice._
    
- You can **omit "–µ—Å–ª–∏"** in very informal or spoken language, though it‚Äôs better to use it in writing.

### üéØ Conclusion

The conditional mood in real conditionals is used to describe possible or likely future situations. Russian forms these using **present/future tense** in the conditional clause and **future tense or imperative** in the result clause. Understanding this structure is essential for expressing cause and effect, plans, and consequences in Russian.
